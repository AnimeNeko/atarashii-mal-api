However, their claymore is a hydrator and their hair dryer flips breakers, and the only invention that's even remotely interesting is their Phone Microwave, which transforms bananas into oozing green gel. But when an experiment goes awry, the gang discovers that the Phone Microwave can also send text messages to the past. And what's more, the words they send can affect the flow of time and have unforeseen, far-reaching consequences&mdash;consequences that Okabe may not be able to handle...<br />

		</div>“No one knows what the future holds. That’s why its potential is infinite.”<br />
Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)<br />
<br />
<br />
Such a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It’s one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it’s an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There’s not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.<br />
But why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
Steins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a “mad scientist” <span style="display: none;" id="review145393">who spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured – and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers’ attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either – in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
This is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn’t a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn’t jaw-dropping. However, this doesn’t mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible – and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Amazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
What can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There’s hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you’ll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Steins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don’t really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn’t refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime – but that’s not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked. So go ahead, you won't waste your precious time. In fact, you might want to go back in time to watch it again!<br />

		</div>"People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non subjective viewpoint it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbley ... timey wimey ... stuff" - The Doctor<br />
<br />
When it comes to entertainment, one of the easiest things to get wrong is the concept of time travel. Part of the reason for this is because our scientific understanding of "reality" is still in its infancy, and this means that the writers for shows like Doctor Who, Quantum Leap, even Star Trek, must apply their imagination and creativity in order to resolve some of the inherent paradoxes that <span style="display: none;" id="review43359">will occur whenever a narrative decides to hop, skip or jump.<br />
<br />
In other words, they make it up.<br />
<br />
More often than not the implausibility of any sort of time travel is camouflaged with pseudo-science, techno-babble, and a good smattering of conversational quantum-hokum. These add a veneer of believability so that the average person can achieve the suspension of disbelief required to buy into the storyline. When it comes to anime though, the concept of travelling through time has generally lacked in substance, delivery, and even narrative relevance.<br />
<br />
Until now ...<br />
<br />
Originally a visual novel by 5pb and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate tells the story of Okabe Rintaro (the self styled mad scientist known as Hououin Kyouma), and his "colleagues" at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Hashida "Daru" Itaru and Shiina Mayuri. Okabe spends his days making strange inventions with Daru, and the oddest one so far is the Phone Microwave [name subject to change]. At first it seems as though this device does nothing more than turn bananas into a green, jelly-like substance, but it has a hidden side effect that no one knows about. Everything seems placid and normal until the day that Okabe and Mayuri decide to attend a lecture given by the eminent Professor Nakabachi on the subject of time machines and time travel.<br />
<br />
For the most part Steins;Gate is a surprisingly well thought out series that applies the notion of cause and effect in a reasonably intelligent manner. The plot follows a logical, if somewhat timeworn progression, and while there are numerous recycles, repeats, reboots, and "do overs" that form an integral part of any time travel tale, these are handled in a way that would have turned Endless Eight from tedium incarnate into an arc that was at least watchable. The show throws around a number of concepts and theories to explain or justify certain  aspects of the science fiction, and on quite a few occasions these have been woven into the main body of the plot very well. Ideas like the Butterfly Effect (which, given the visual cues, should be obvious to anyone), the Observer Effect and Schrödinger's Cat have been used to support the problems caused by time travel (and their resolution), and in that respect Steins;Gate deserves a good deal of praise for trying to use science to support the science fiction (and it does it far better than the likes of Puella Magi Madoka Magica).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it's not all fun and games.<br />
<br />
One of the problems within the narrative is the inevitable conflict between human drama and science fiction, and in true anime fashion the emotional side wins out. This has the unfortunate effect of removing much of the chaos that is inherent in a story about time travel, and replacing it with predictability and melodrama. Thankfully the human side of the tale is handled in a surprisingly decent manner, but this is tempered by the fact that a number of basic questions are never actually addressed. The very nature of this anime automatically requires that certain aspects be resolved or explained, and while there are all sorts of "scientific" reasons flying around, the series tends to shy away from tackling certain first order issues like the Grandfather Paradox.<br />
<br />
There's also the matter of the rather "neat" ending, but we'll get to that in a bit.<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate is a very good looking series, but as with any adaptation from another visual medium, there's an automatic limitation placed on aspects like character design. That said, White Fox have produced a series that viewers may find appealing, if a little generic at times, and have used what they've been given to very good effect. The character animation is of a high standard, and many of the visual effects are imaginative and well choreographed (which should be no surprise given that White Fox also produced Tears to Tiara and Katanagatari). It's unfortunate then, that the typical anime mentality comes to the fore in the little details, the main one being the distinct lack of variety where clothing is concerned. Everyone seems to have only one outfit, which may seem a little picky to some, but imagine how you would feel if you wore the same underwear for three weeks while running around and in mostly warm weather.<br />
<br />
This mentality also comes to the fore in the script, and while the majority of the dialogue in the show is actually pretty good, the usual shenanigans come out to play at times when there really doesn't need to be any more drama. Thankfully the voice actors are experienced enough to know how to deal with the scriptwriters' attempts at overcompensating for various shortcomings, and in truth they're the ones that carry this series. If it wasn't for the talents of Miyano Mamoru, Imai Asami, Seki Tomokazu, Hanazawa Kana, and the rest of the cast, Steins;Gate would quickly collapse under its own weight, and it's thanks to the seiyuu's abilities that the more technical or scientific portions of the script can be delivered in a manner that fits with the narrative.<br />
<br />
The opening sequence features Hacking The Gate by Ito Kanako, a fairly average J-pop track track that has been set to a montage of most of the characters who seem to be deep in contemplation while a variety of clock faces, cogs and technical looking diagrams zip around the screen. On the other hand, The Twelve Time Governing Covenants by Sakakibara Yui works rather well as the  closing theme, and for the most part the end sequence is a far more subtle and off kilter affair that is more in tune with the atmosphere of the series proper (until the last few seconds that is, and one has to wonder about the mentality of the person who thought ending the sequence like that was a good idea).<br />
<br />
As for the background music, there's a rather nice variety of tracks that are often very subtly used. More often than not the series relies on mundane noises and silence, and because of that attention has been paid to the timing and usage of the score.<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate has a core set of characters who are surprisingly well defined from the start of the series, but in terms of overall development much of the growth applies only to Okabe. Now this isn't really surprising given the events in the story, and to be honest the show is actually better with his character being the only one who truly changes. Okabe's development when dealing with the events that are rapidly spiralling out of control is handled in a sensitive yet realistic manner, and it's nice to see that the anime hasn't shied away from depicting the apathy he feels after experiencing a series of personally harrowing events.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the attempts to further develop some of the other characters tend to fall a little short of the mark, and this leads to a few situations that effectively remove the dramatic tension that has been painstakingly built up. The sad part is that while it's laudable to try and develop characters like Suzu, Mayuri, Feyris, and even Tennouji Yugo (Mr Braun), this should never come at the detriment of the main storyline.<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate is a very entertaining series that isn't afraid to play around with various scientific concepts, but at the same time it clearly avoids tackling certain major issues related to time travel, and the focus on human drama can sometimes be at odds with the events in the storyline. That said, it's a very enjoyable anime that doesn't get too bogged down in technicalities, and while I rather liked the fact that Okabe cast himself in the role of mad scientist (complete with laugh), imagine my surprise at finding out he's supposed to be 18 years old.<br />
<br />
Which brings us back to the ending.<br />
<br />
There's a certain ... "clinical" ... feel to the conclusion that really doesn't sit too well, and while it's always nice to see a story end happily, one has to wonder about the plausibility of it all. The thing is, Steins;Gate uses a concept of time travel similar to that used in Quantum Leap, and therein lies the problem. Anyone who is familiar with the latter series knows that Dr Sam Beckett (an actual doctor, not an 18 year old first year student like Okabe), is unable to return to his original timeline because too many changes have been made to past events. In the nomenclature of Steins;Gate, he's moved across too many world lines and affected too many lives, and this is one of the major things that Steins;Gate glosses over completely. Now one could argue that the idea used in the series creates an effective escape clause, but that only covers certain people. The simple fact is that everyone you meet when you travel through time, no matter how brief the contact, is affected by your presence, so in order to return to one's original timeline, one must undo every contact with every person, even down to brushing shoulders with a total stranger on the street.<br />
<br />
One of the other aspects that really should have been explored is Okabe's ability, Reading Steiner. At no point does the series delve into why he has this ability or how it works, and this is more than a little odd given how much importance is placed on "Fool yourself. Fool the world".<br />
<br />
Even with those issues though, Steins;Gate is easily one of the better science fiction anime to appear in the last few years, and while there are areas that could have been improved upon, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Steins;Gate is an enjoyable romp in the realms of implausibility that delivers on several levels, and while the happy ending may not sit well with everyone, the conclusion to the story does offer a degree of catharsis.<br />
<br />
It's just a shame that everyone seems to think you need a happy ending in order to make a story great.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle43359" class="js-review-btn-readmore" onclick="reviewToggleText(43359)" data-id="43359">read more</a></div>

		</div>The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. For Steins;Gate, that hard work paid off. This is by far the best-executed time travel story that I've ever seen in my experience with anime, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're definitely missing out!<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
The story revolves around the antics of Rintarou Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist that goes by the alias "Hououin Kyouma," as he essentially dicks around with time and subsequently deals with the consequences of his selfish actions. I'll be completely honest <span style="display: none;" id="review116675">and say that the incredibly slow and random start to the anime threw me off so much that I re-watched the first episode 4 times over the course of 6 months before I could resolve to just pushing onward and finishing the anime. However, this slow start is balanced out by the fast-paced second half. By the end, it was answering questions that I never thought to ask, pointing out the significance of things that had long been discarded by my mind, and that sense of tying up loose ends is just the most refreshing feeling to have after dealing with so many time travel stories that are too lazy to clean up after themselves.<br />
<br />
Unlike many time travel stories, especially in the world of anime, Steins;Gate has no noticeable inconsistencies objectively. I say objectively because this is a science fiction story, and that makes it really hard for everyone to agree on it. The thing is, none of us have experienced time travel in the way the characters in these science fiction stories have (and if you have experienced it, I'm very sorry for making assumptions), so there isn't a clear right or wrong way to write a time travel story. Obviously, if a story contradicts itself, something went wrong. But Steins;Gate seems to obey its own rules, and while a lot of people have made very compelling arguments that point out flaws in Steins;Gate's concept of time travel, they all make assumptions about how time travel works, and no one can really say for sure how things would change if we altered the past. <br />
<br />
In the end, this isn't a science textbook, it's a science fiction anime. It's not supposed to be 100% believable, otherwise we wouldn't be able to watch it and say "wow, that was unbelievable!" I give the story a 10/10 because it was interesting, well-researched (many ideas are borrowed from other works of science fiction and played with), and overall just plain entertaining. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
I really prefer talking about the art of a particularly spectacular-looking anime or else a particularly underwhelming-looking anime. Since the art in Steins;Gate is neither extremely good or extremely bad, I'll rate it an 8/10 for not influencing my opinion of the anime in either direction. Consider it a passing grade, basically where we should expect the art quality of anime to be in this day and age. Anything better would be remarkable.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
I can't say much for the soundtrack, but the voice acting is awesome! Okabe's seiyuu is all kinds of talented, but everything good about the sound in this anime, and really, everything good about life in general, can be summed up in the maniacal laugh of Hououin Kyouma. I can't really speak for the English dub, and while I love Michael J. Tatum's work in Baccano, what I've heard of the dub sounds to be sorely lacking compared to the Japanese voices. Miyano Mamoru is just so cool! Sonuvabitch!<br />
<br />
One thing of note about the soundtrack is the lack of one for a large portion of the anime. During quiet moments, rather than listening to quiet music, you're usually just listening to nothing. This is something that I've seen a few times, and I think it's pretty cool. It accentuates the importance of those scenes that do have music, and at the very least creates a nice contrast of mood, not between happy and sad music, but between silence and... not silence.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
You should know that while not each and every character is the pinnacle of how great anime characters can be, they're all very interesting, entertaining, and Hououin Kyouma can handle being the pinnacle of just about everything.<br />
<br />
But really, my rule for judging a character to be good  is that I either like them or appreciate how much I don't like them. There are characters that I like and characters that I don't like in Steins;Gate, but all of them fit, and none of them are pointless and annoying. And yeah, Okabe is startlingly charismatic, and that can take an anime pretty far in the character department.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
This anime made me laugh maniacally and cry silently. It also made me think, and it rewarded my thoughts by having closure and clarity, which left me more than satisfied. Easily a 10/10 anime, and now one of my favorites that I've seen!</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle116675" class="js-review-btn-readmore" onclick="reviewToggleText(116675)" data-id="116675">read more</a></div>

		</div>As you may have noticed, Steins;Gate is revered as a masterpiece by most.  For those of you who haven't had the privilege of watching this show yet, i'm writing this (belated) review to emphasize just how much you're missing out on. <br />
<br />
First of all, you have to understand that Steins;Gate is completely unique compared to other anime, in terms of story line. Now, with such a complex plot, it would be incredibly easy to mess the series up. Except that they didn't. If they did, it wouldn't a masterpiece. Steins;Gate explores the world of time travelling and time lines, putting in acknowledgements to theories <span style="display: none;" id="review114977">such as the butterfly effect and how, once you change a minor thing of the past, the future transitions into one large scrambled egg. Once you pass the first slow starting episodes, the intrigue and mystery begins, and the pace of the series accelerates. The plot throws in numerous surprises and sudden, unexpected turns that, in turn, creates a powerful ending that is almost flawless. Also, you're hit bluntly in the face with quite a lot of feels early on in the series. <br />
<br />
One of the great things about Steins;Gate is that the characters are developed incredibly well. Astonishingly well. To the point that you feel connected with them in terms of their feelings and aims. They each have their quirky side too - not everything is all serious. I'm talking about the mad scientist personality, the Dr.Pepper jokes and Daru's perverted jokes which lightens up the series so that it isn't all serious drama. But the trouble is, the more like able the characters are, the harder you find it to leave them behind when the series ends, meaning that even a week after Steins;Gate ends, you'll probably still be thinking about Okabe whenever you spot a bottle of Dr.Pepper. <br />
<br />
I didn't really pay attention much to the soundtrack of the series, i admit, due to the fact that i didn't find it all that enthralling or unique. However, i did enjoy the opening and the ending particularly. Aside from that, the soundtrack did it's job of emphasizing the mood/atmosphere of scenes pretty well. <br />
The animation in itself was done really well though - i found that the consistency was great, meaning that (to my eye) there was no sudden drops in quality. <br />
<br />
Something that i loved the most was that the ending was fantastic. There were barely any loose threads, and as a poor ending can sometimes ruin a good series, i'm grateful that they executed such a content finale. <br />
<br />
I stress that you must watch this series. It's not enough for you to read however many reviews you can lay your eyes on, but to actually experience this masterpiece for yourself. <br />

The middle of both anime have the same plot related issue as well, but I won't spoil anything. &nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Both of these animes are like a rollercoaster. First, it seems to progress steadily and introduce many seemingly-positive characters and ideas, then the intense sh*t happens and you have an absolutely amazing and dark, twistiness of a plot that will most likely cause you to binge-watch the rest of the series until you finish and/or your probably boggled mind leads to an explosion of multiple feels all at once, in an outstanding way!&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">These two anime are similar in that they both deal with the balance of the world and the changes in different timelines. They also show the different sacrifices that have to be made in order to obtain what is necessary. However, Steins;Gate provides more character development compared to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, probably because of the longer length in the number of episodes.&nbsp;</div>

In both shows are gradually shown deeper and darker layers of tragic story about desperate fight to change seemingly inevitable fate of heroines, who too late learn that using their new power has its price.<br />
<br />
Don't be deceived by sugary opening and first episodes of Madoka! It's MUCH darker than it appears at first look, I would even say it is far more serious and dramatic than S;G. Story is written by Gen Urobuchi, who publicly "apologized for intentionally misleading people that Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is a cute healing anime". Wikipedia describes its <span style="display: none;" id="recommend61325">genre as "Drama, Horror, Magical girl, Tragedy", and MAL as "Magic, Psychological, Thriller".</span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle61325" onclick="recommendToggleText(61325)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

Both start out as what seem to be very lighthearted and playful only to suddenly become really dark and serious. Moreover, both have a heavy focus on the suffering of the characters.

This is just my opinion, but I wouldn't hesitate to say these two are both modern anime masterpieces.&nbsp;</div>

+ Both start off as cheerful, but gets increasingly darker. <br />
+ Both have a similar theme going on. Saying what would be spoiler territory.<br />

<br />
-  Steins;Gate still retains some lightheartedness even in the end. Madoka does not have this treatment.<br />
- Steins;Gate focuses on the "theme" they share, while in Madoka's its one of many.<br />
- Madoka is considered to be more emotional, while Steins;Gate to be inspiring.&nbsp;</div>

The cast will get you attached and begging for more. The art style is very different between the two, a very pleasing type of different. Madoka has a very abstract style that it goes by while Steins; Gate uses more of a realism. Both art styles fit the anime beautifully and bring out the true feel for who the characters are. The characters are wonderful and the overall feel will leave you to wonder what will happen next. <br <span style="display: none;" id="recommend110568">/>
<br />
Both are my personal favorites. A recommendation for both of them. <br />
<br />
Steins; Gate- After you watch it rewatch it.<br />
<br />
Madoka- I feel it should be watched through the movies, Beginnings (1), Eternal (2) and Rebellion (3, also different story). The first two are just all of the episodes put together with new scenes that add onto the feel I feel it adds onto the character development as well. </span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle110568" onclick="recommendToggleText(110568)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Both of these series are psychological thrillers and involve the main characters determined to do anything to save the one they love. They both also have a very similar concept that actually compliments each other quite well though you have to watch both to understand what I mean. This is just my opinion, but both series have been regarded as masterpieces in their own right though your own opinion can vary. Madoka Magica in particular, is a controversial series that may have things that you might not like. Don't let that turn you off as both Steins;Gate and Madoka Magica are special series that contain <span style="display: none;" id="recommend113705">a lot of meaning and hidden messages in it. For anyone that hasn't seen Madoka Magica, it may not look like a psychological thriller at first. There are slight hints, but the series really shows its true colors on episode 3 so I recommend giving this the otaku three episode rule. Overall, if you enjoyed one, then you'll most likely enjoy the other and personally, these series both deserve a watch. But then again, this is just my opinion.</span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle113705" onclick="recommendToggleText(113705)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Mindbending excitement.....there is also, surprisingly huge similarities in the plot. I feel like both of them are those "expect nothing, get EVERYTHING" kind of animes. Both anime start off with simple, easy to understand plots, that don't bore you before they get REALLLY good. Trust me, to those who watched Stein's;Gate and think it is as original and one of a kind as it get's....well it is. But Madoka sure make's a good counter. Personally, I perfered Madoka to Stein's;Gate (barely, but there both FANTASTIC IN EVERYWAY POSSIBLE), but if you've watched and enjoyed one of them you will love the other as well!&nbsp;</div>

These animes has one very similar aspect, but with one big difference.<br />

In mirai nikki you know your future, in steins gate you know your past. They know how to change their future in mirai nikki and they know how to change their past in steins gate. But what they both do not know is what will happen if they change it. Even the fact if you make it worse or better is never clear. Of course you can always think that it cannot get any badder. <br />
<br />
The other fact is that they know their past and future immediately after that. <span style="display: none;" id="recommend86085">So they can change it once more.<br />

The big difference is of course future and past in this theorie.

					<div class="spaceit_pad">About time-travelling and its consequences. Stein's Gate is more focused on the science fiction aspect of time-travelling, while Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo is more about using time-travelling as a device of telling us an important life lesson.&nbsp;</div>

They both are character based in that the main character is the bond that will ultimately carry you to finishing them and both of these anime contain elements of suspense and comedy with a dash of romance. If you are a fan of any sort of science fiction element involving time travel or likable characters then this entry will certainly satisfy you.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">While "Welcome to the NHK" and "Steins;Gate" aren't all similar in overarching plot nor animation style, there is something about the "normality" of the two shows that can't be overlooked.<br />
<br />
Both are them are set in a realistic, believable world, without over-the-top characters. Dialogue is witty and sensible, and both start off relatively harmless, but eventually delve into the psychological drama type of anime.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">The many-worlds interpretation and quantum physics. Not your usual anime bedfellows. Both series deal with time travel under the assumption that every choice we make can create an alternate, divergent time-line / dimension. <br />
<br />
Noein is a lot more ambitious than Steins;Gate, which preferred to stay within time travel limited to days-weeks and the same area. In Noein, the other selves of the child cast time travel with enhanced bodies; conversing with their younger selves as they fight using superpowers and struggle to sustain their bodies in a dimension they don't belong in. The future involving an entity known as 'Noein' destroying all alternate <span style="display: none;" id="recommend102383">dimensions is a clear reality. Steins, on the other hand, shows nothing of its future; just mentioning what happens.<br />
<br />
Okabe in Steins uses time travel between time-lines as a sort of... ladder. He has to do such and such to make a number go high enough to change from a few preset futures. Noein differs in its approach since it presents each dimension as an individual one that all lead to doom only because one of the other dimensions is destroying the others. </span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle102383" onclick="recommendToggleText(102383)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Both anime is about time-travelling and the mechanism is used excellently in both stories. Noein spends a bit more time with the "future" worlds than Steins;Gate does and feels a bit more darker/moody than Steins;Gate because the latter had more funny dialogue. Aside from that, Steins;Gate generally had better characters so expect some differences in characterization (Noein had a younger cast in the present timelines), but character developments in both was quite well done.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="borderClass bgColor1" style="padding: 3px; border-width: 1px 0 0 0; margin: 4px 0;">
					<div class="spaceit_pad">Noein is the "kiddo" version of Steins;Gate. Both have time-travel plot, and in both the hero wants desperately to save the girl he loves and his friends from a terrible event and at the same time prevent an horrible future to humanity. Both are a great watch.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Parallel worlds, time travel, convergence, unlimited possible futures, hopelessness, despair, different space-time theories, inability to escape from fate and of course people who (un)willingly screw everything up... They share so many tropes! Even the character design is somewhat similar, although Noein takes more risks, I'd say. It seems to me that Steins;Gate is more otaku-oriented while Noein is more of a slice-of-life and romance. Nonetheless, both anime excel in plot twists and characterization, as well as entertainment value.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="borderClass bgColor1" style="padding: 3px; border-width: 1px 0 0 0; margin: 4px 0;">
					<div class="spaceit_pad">Both shows depict Time traveling with unlimited possibilities. Both shows that the main character has the ability to view the other timelines.<br />
<br />
Noein focuses more on the Dragon Knights from La'cryma (one of Earth's possible future) coming to the present to retrieve an 'object' called 'Dragon Torque' in order to save their world. As the Dragon knights enters into this timeline (the present) by accident, one of the Knights realised that this timeline is very similar to theirs and swore to protect the dragon torque at all costs. The others insists that it is just an illusion and the torque is just a tool, <span style="display: none;" id="recommend32891">but he swore to not cause damage into this timeline.<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate focuses on one group of people who managed to create the worlds first time machine. The main character kept experimenting with it and realises that it can be used to change the past, present, future by sending just an message. He tries to help his friends to change the world into a pleasant world for them when he realises that, for each message that he sents, one of his friend would be killed a day earlier. Whats more, they found out that a few years later, a corporation would use their time machine to rule over the world, turning everybody into human slaves. In order to prevent these from happening, he needs to cause minimal changes onto a world to save his assistant to prevent this incident to occur. Thus he set off going trough crazy amount of time trying to save both people.<br />
<br />
Both shows can cause a viewer to be confused  although Noein's confusion occurs later in the show compared to Steins;Gate.</span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle32891" onclick="recommendToggleText(32891)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Both are Sci-Fi anime dealing with time travel and alternate realities/worlds. However, Steins Gate is the grown-up version of Noein--it does not have the amazing musical score that Noein has, but it definitely has more mature themes. This anime makes you think, while Noein captivates more than anything (though it certainly makes you think too). <br />
<br />
Give this anime the first 10 episodes for plot and character development--THEN it gets exciting and addictive. But all of the episodes are beautifully done (acting and artwork are amazing). The artwork stays amazing throughout the whole series--there were probably only a couple of moments when I thought <span style="display: none;" id="recommend49599">it was less than the best.

 - Both consider time travel and infinite possible futures.<br />
 - Both are incredibly confusing for most of the show, so watch out. They also take a rewatch or two to fully understand (even then, there's still some confusion!).<br />
 - Both revolve around relationships with friends, family, lovers, and generally keeping together to reach a greater goal.<br />
<br />
Some differences include: <br />
 - Noein is more fantasy whereas Steins;Gate tries to be more realistic.<br />
 - The art styles and music played throughout the shows are very different.&nbsp;</div>
