		</div>Lucky star is one of those unique Comedy anime that comes very rarely. It manages to put a comedic twist to normal everyday occurances, and many pop culutre references. The entire show is not your typical slice of life high school comedy anime, rather its show structure follows more of a western style of comedy, a sitcom to be exact. Instead  of having a direct storyline, like  most anime viewers are used to, it focuses more of everyday observations and Jpop culture as their source of comedy.<br />
<br />
---Theres always a storyline no matter how broad it is. Many ppl say theres no story line <span style="display: none;" id="review879">but, there has to be a &quot;story&quot; of sorts or else this stuff cant be funny. If you had to put a plot to this show it would &quot;A group of high school children trying to make it all the way through high school.&quot; With such a broad plot, the creators can do as they please. By the way, that is how most western sitcoms can list 5-10 seasons without it getting old (i.e. Simpsons, Family Guy, Cheers, etc.) Mind you thats the only connection this show has with a western sitcom. <br />
---I have noticed many people bash the begging episodes of the show but i found them equally entertaining as the rest of them. It really depends on what the viewer does in their own daily lives is what truly makes this show funny. Somone who doesnt eat curry/rice or grilled meat sticks for dinner with their family wont understand a joke about it. But with all the jokes and references  in this show you&#039;re bound to laugh out loud at all they throw at you! They&#039;ve thoguht of everything for this show. <br />
<br />
---Art and animation of the show is your typical comedy anime fair. Simple characters simple backgrounds simple static objects. But they manage to take &quot;simple&quot; to a whole different level. For example, the characters are only shown from the waist up for about 80% of the entire show. But the characters are drawn very simplistic and the coloring for each looks like it doesnt exeed 12 different colors for each person for the most part. But they are definitely drawn in a cute manner, if thats your thing. The simple-ness is what gives the show its charm too. The art style is so popular and easy to draw im sure you&#039;ll find spoofs for dozens of other non related characters around the internet. <br />
<br />
---The Sound is your standard comedy sound efects from light hearted piano songs, to bing bangs and bongs, they&#039;re all there and accounted for. Music is mostly absent from the show aside from helping out certain jokes.<br />
---You will definitely notice the lack of background music in the show but with such a powerful seiyu cast, one could understand that they didnt want to distract from the well executed voice acting. Of course most people will notice Aya Hirano and maybe even Minori Chihara. Its hard to believe that most of the main characters are voiced by relatively newcomers. Which also helps seperate Lucky Star from sounding the same as all the other school anime out there. You&#039;ll enjoy Kagami&#039;s singing voice by the way. <br />
<br />
With the uniqe sound comes the &quot;unique&quot; (or not so unique) character types associated with each seiyu.  Theres also ALOT more characters but you&#039;ll have to watch it to see them all ^_^  Speaking of characters you&#039;ll actually end up seeing all of them fairly regurlarly. Either supporting cast or main cast. By the end of the show, you&#039;ll get the feeling that not one person recieved more time than another. Even the extra characters get more than enough airtime to fully acknowledge them as essential parts of the anime. <br />
<br />
---The enjoyment factor is through the roof in my opinion. The comedy aspect of this show covers so many angles and hits so many things perfectly its hard not to give a perfect score. I find it very hard for somone to hate this anime. That is, if you dont like japanese pop cultre, anime references and funny common occurences. If youre that type then why are you watching anime? ^_^<br />
---Also, if you dont like western style sitcoms where the end of every episode will always leave the same way they started, this is definitely not for you. If youre looking for a romantic comedy or bloody action school go somewhere else.  If you&#039;re willing to give up about 20 minutes of your time for pure entertainment, WATCH THIS SHOW!<br />
<br />
If you find anything funnier pm me i&#039;ll give it a shot but for now this the funniest anime i&#039;ve watched to date ^_^</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle879" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="879">read more</a></div>

		</div>&quot;This is so BORING!&quot; is what most of you will say if you watch it.<br />
I&#039;ll admit, that is what I thought at first, and I stopped watching on the first episode when they were talking about which side is the head of a &quot;chocolate cornet bread&quot;... But after a while, I gave it another try, and this time, I watched patiently and watched through the entire first episode. I was still not impressed, and still bored. I moved on to the next episode, and as you can tell by my over-all rating of a 10, I loved the rest. Now here is why:<br />
The story, is <span style="display: none;" id="review88699">non-existent (as I will put no emphasis on story in this review). But that was one of the main reasons I loved it. There was no tension, no fighting, no drama, no heart-breaks. Just pure comedy. <br />
Comedy? Well, there&#039;s nothing that will make you roll over. But, there are countless moments where it makes you smile, many times even chuckles if you get the jokes. <br />
The comedy works in this anime by having the characters go through moments where you go like, &quot;OH I feel you!&quot;, &quot;I totally know what you mean!, or &quot;Ah so glad I am not the only one who does that!&quot;. That&#039;s why it&#039;s really funny in a way, making this the most accurate &quot;slice of life&quot; I have ever viewed. <br />
The English dub for this anime is pretty amazing (for once), the voice actor for Konata, the main character, does a wonderful job of bring her to life. The characters are all likable, but Konata is one of the best characters I have seen, and she manages to do all that without geass powers or sword skills, too. I don&#039;t want to spoil anything, so I will leave it up to you to find out more about why I find Konata so great.<br />
Also, it&#039;s a huge plus if you are exposed to Japanese culture (real life), because many of the jokes is about the daily life there and you will only get the jokes if you have experienced it (there aren&#039;t that many, so don&#039;t worry).<br />
To sum it up, Lucky Star is about the daily life of the girls, there won&#039;t be any conflicts like there are in many slice of life anime, this anime is very peaceful, and you can relate to many of the characters.<br />
Give it a try! Watch a few clips of it! Type in &quot;Funny Lucky Star Moments&quot; on Youtube and see for yourself! If you like it, WATCH IT. Don&#039;t marathon it, in fact, watch an episode after a long day, or better yet, watch it to calm your nerves after something like Code Geass/Death Note.

		</div>There is nothing in entertainment worse than bad comedy.<br />
<br />
Bad drama, horror, romance, or action at least has the possibility of being amusing, if only for purely ironical purposes, and watching something which is intended to be serious completely fail can be surprisingly fun (see MST3K). However, watching something try to be funny and fail is hardly ever amusing in the slightest, and amounts, for me at least, to the epitome of nauseating boredom. In the anime world, Lucky Star is perhaps the best (and at the very least the most popular) example of bad comedy ever made.<br />
<br />
Now, it is more or less universally agreed upon <span style="display: none;" id="review27941">amongst Lucky Star&#039;s detractors that the show is, quite simply, &quot;unfunny.&quot; At the same time however, it is not always explained in detail why or how it is unfunny. But before delving into the specifics, I will freely admit from the outset that comedy is probably the most subjective and difficult of all genres (I myself have some bizarre comedic tastes) to review. Nevertheless, I believe Lucky Star merits special attention, along with a special place in Hell, for how unprecedentedly unfunny it is. This is also why I chose it for my inaugural anime review.<br />
<br />
Basically, the &quot;humor&quot; of Lucky Star is derived from two sources: 1) Discussions about everyday life experience (e.g. food, homework, clothes), and 2) References (either verbal or visual) to other anime franchises and various anime-related tropes. As for the first, Lucky Star makes the awful mistake of assuming that simply because something is true or commonly experienced, it is funny. Thus the episodes are crammed with inane, excruciatingly detailed conversational gems like<br />
 <br />
Person 1: &quot;You know how when it&#039;s cold outside, you want to stay inside for longer?&quot;<br />
Person 2: &quot;Haha yeah, I&#039;ve totally been there!&quot;<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Person 1: &quot;You know how when you have a lot of stuff to do, you clean your room instead?&quot;<br />
Person 2: &quot;Haha yeah, I&#039;ve done that before!&quot;<br />
<br />
You get the idea. The whole &quot;funny because it&#039;s true&quot; thing in my experience only works if it is comingled with an adequate amount of absurdity or exaggeration (for an example, see Mike Judge&#039;s films). Lucky Star, on the other hand, aims for pure realism in all its dullness. With this &quot;comedic&quot; logic, they may as well assume that simply because I have eaten food before, I will think that watching people eat food is funny; furthermore, I will think that people talking about eating food is also funny. What makes this method even more ridiculous for Lucky Star is the fact that one must be rather extensively versed in Japanese culture to even &quot;get&quot; a lot of these &quot;jokes,&quot; let alone find them funny.<br />
<br />
As for the anime references, this is where the annoyance factor truly rears its ugly head. Typically, an outside reference to another anime is funny because it is unexpected and well-timed. Lucky Star on the other hand, crams in as many references as it possibly can, many of which are to other works from Kyoto Animation. As one might imagine, this not only gets incredibly dull, but also unbearably irritating as the show progresses. By far the most frequent and most facepalm-inducing are the references to the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Granted, this trick was somewhat amusing the first time, but by the end of the series, the Haruhi references become so frequent, so bland, and so obvious that I literally began slamming my head into my desk. Thus like the reference to &quot;everyday life,&quot; the references to anime make the assumption that just because we have seen the shows referenced, that we will find the references funny. Are we really supposed to pat ourselves on the back and quietly snicker to ourselves for being &quot;in the know&quot;? It seems like the real reason for all these anime references is a) a clever form of product-placement and b) riding on the success of vastly superior franchises (Full Metal Panic, Haruhi Suzumiya, the Key-game shows). The only reference that actually made me chuckle a bit (and not immediately roll my eyes or want to punch my computer screen) was the part in episode 13 where one of the shop employees uses his &quot;Geass&quot; on Konata to get her to buy a DVD, only to find that she is three yen short.<br />
<br />
Now typically, in order to use reference-parodies like this successfully, one ought to find a way to integrate them in a creative and subtle way, and there are many examples of this in anime alone. Lucky Star, on the other hand, particularly when parodying well-known anime tropes, squanders its comedic potential by feeling the need to tell you exactly what they are parodying. Therefore, whenever Miyuki trips or turns off the light by accident, or Yutaka mentions that she is frail and &quot;sick all the time,&quot; we are sure to have Konata not far off to immediately comment how incredibly &quot;moe&quot; she is. Ha. Ha. Ha. There is a similar delivery style with &quot;tsundere,&quot; &quot;fanservice,&quot; and other related terms and cliches. Watching this is like listening to someone tell a joke only to quickly explain the punchline before the audience even has a chance to laugh.<br />
<br />
Aesthetically, there is not terribly much to say other than I find it amazing that even here Lucky Star manages to add yet another layer of annoyance. The characters were clearly designed to resemble the (equally unfunny) manga as closely as possible, and the result is not pleasing. The foreground and background art is lackluster and totally generic, not to mention the core girls all look waaaay too young (and not just in a typical &quot;moe&quot; way) for being in high school. Such failure in this department is all the more surprising knowing that this show was produced by Kyoto Animation, a studio which, among other things, is particularly well known for its beautiful and groundbreaking visual styling. In Lucky Star, there is no such evidence whatsoever that this is the same company who did Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Air, or Kanon. I suspect the real reason Kyoto took this project on was because of potential legal issues surrounding the ludicrous amounts of references to their other works. Other than that, the music consists of bland, forgettable five-note pieces typical for this kind of show. Except worse.<br />
<br />
Setting aside for a moment what Lucky Star has brings up the important issue of what it does not have. In fact, one of Lucky Star&#039;s most subtle and yet most serious detriments is the almost complete absence of visual humor of any kind (the stock anime-facial-expressions aside). The show is quite simply a bunch of talking heads, and as something in the medium of animation, Lucky Star feels incredibly out of place; 99% of the show consist of dialogue and dialogue only. Suffice it to say, this show was a complete and unfortunate waste of Kyoto&#039;s talent.<br />
<br />
All in all, my biggest problem with Lucky Star, and the reason why I have been compelled to write this review, is that it basically gives slice of life comedy a bad name--something which is all the more compounded by its rabid popularity. It is not at all unlikely that someone who has never seen a slice of life show will first see Lucky Star and then assume that the entire genre is of similar quality. After all, comments like &quot;nothing happens&quot; and &quot;there&#039;s no plot&quot; are fairly common amongst complaints from Lucky Star haters. Unfortunately, I believe people may be missing out on a lot of great, funny, clever slice of life shows &quot;where there&#039;s no plot&quot; (Fumoffu, Azumanga Daioh, Minami-ke) if Lucky Star does indeed manage to taint them so severely. It is interesting to note that Lucky Star is perhaps most often mentioned along with the classic Azumanga Daioh, and the comparison is not at all unmerited: both shows are based off of a four-panel manga about a group of quirky high school girls and their antics. However, once the stylistic similarities are brushed aside, you are left with two anime which could not be more diametrically opposed. That is, whereas Azumanga Daioh represents the pinnacle of comedy done right, Lucky Star represent the pinnacle of comedy done wrong; whereas Azumanga Daioh uses &quot;random conversations about food&quot; in a broader, situational context to give them humorous contrast, Lucky Star takes this device to a ridiculous extreme--it makes an entire show out of it to the expense of nearly everything else. The difference between Azumanga&#039;s Osaka and Lucky Star&#039;s Konata is that the former is one character amongst many, whereas the latter is only an otaku-pandering, watered-down Osaka amongst many other watered-down Osaka&#039;s, without any significant personality contrast. In Lucky Star, there is no one to sarcastically say &quot;wow, you have a really vivid imagination...&quot; but rather the one-note &quot;joke&quot; of &quot;randomness&quot; continues on into senseless oblivion. If Azumanga Daioh is a bright beacon of joyful, energetic laughter, Lucky Star is a dark pit of disparaging, cynical boredom (if you&#039;ll excuse the melodramatic language). It basically takes the slice of life genre but does not fill it with any real content, leaving naught but an empty husk.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, if you want a creative, genuine, funny slice-of-life comedy and not simply a long otaku in-joke set on repeat, avoid Lucky Star like the plague.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle27941" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="27941">read more</a></div>

		</div>When I first looked into Lucky Star, I thought I was going to be impressed. People in the anime club I help run wanted to watch this series so bad and it ended up in 4th place, so we weren&#039;t able to show it this semester. Still, I wanted to know what the appeal of Lucky Star was. The chibi art made the anime look unique and interesting, and I thought that I couldn&#039;t go wrong with an anime series that was so popular. This is where &quot;looks can be deceiving&quot; really comes into play.<br />
<br />
Despite the cute art, which got annoying very quickly, Lucky Star <span style="display: none;" id="review24152">really fell on its face form the get-go. The story had nothing to offer. Basically, you spend twenty-four episodes watching a group of high school girls run around, talk to each other, make jokes, and dance. I have completely summarized the entire series for you in that last sentence, and I&#039;m not kidding. Each episode was a repeat as the last, except for character problems and issues, and after every episode I said, &quot;Alright, it still has to get better from here,&quot; and it never did. The only thing that ever improved was the Lucky Channel, but that was because I didn&#039;t have to hear Akira&#039;s annoying squeaking in the last three or so episodes.<br />
<br />
I know that the story is suppose to be based around a comedic high school cast, but to be honest, the comedy was terrible. In order to get most of the jokes, one would have to know a lot in video games, anime, and Japanese puns. Now, I don&#039;t know a lot of video games or Japanese puns, so those jokes failed, and the anime jokes that I did get surfaced once in a while, and that type of comedy was absolutely terrible. I think I snickered maybe once or twice during the entire series. Yes, the entire series.<br />
<br />
Along with Lucky Star&#039;s terrible story and comedy choice, I found myself hating most of the characters. The only half-way decent characters were shown in the last half of the anime, and those characters really weren&#039;t anything special. Most of the weren&#039;t dynamic, lacking originality, and went along with the same thing over and over again. When those sparks of originality were shown, they were quickly covered by the same old, bland things that happened through out the entire series. A great example comes from Konata, the main girl with blue hair and green eyes. She runs around every episode, talks about food, anime, video games, and how she was late or tired because she stayed up all night playing video games. Kagami, one of the lavender haired twins, is exactly the same way - smart, angered easily, and is very poor at house chores. Miyuki, the pink haired girl with glasses, is klutsy, &quot;moe&quot;, intelligent, and formal with her speech. I could go on and on, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s needed.<br />
<br />
With the characters, art, and story quickly falling apart, I turned to something I thought would work - the music. I learned quickly, however, that the music was only a little better than everything else. Some of the songs sounded like they were recorded on a cellphone and then placed into the show. It wasn&#039;t that the quality was bad, but rather than the music used was very bland, unoriginal, and lacked dynamic, not that the story had any of those or anything. The music fit the series alright, but by itself, the music would just be a waste of space on whatever drive you would be listening to it on. Even the opening theme was annoying.<br />
<br />
So, with all of these things said, I&#039;m surprised that I made it to the last episode. Now, it&#039;s safe to say that just because I didn&#039;t enjoy it doesn&#039;t mean that others won&#039;t. Obviously, the MAL rating for Lucky Star fights any point that I&#039;ve made against the series. However, I will not be recommending Lucky Star to any of my friends. Ever. In fact, I will tell them to avoid it, and to be fair in my fight, I don&#039;t think it deserves the popularity it has. Sure it&#039;s cute, but that&#039;s about it.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle24152" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="24152">read more</a></div>

		</div>Lucky Star. With an odd title like that, one is left to wonder what this show is all about. A more appropriate and less obscure name would be &quot;Killing yourself with boredom&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Just want a moment to say this. OVERRATED. You could watch the first few minutes of Lucky Star or you could repeatedly hit yourself on the head with a brick. The effect is surprisingly similar.<br />
<br />
I wasnt sure on what to do with this anime. Was it supposed to be funny? How? I cant find one thing about it funny! Am I supposed to enjoy how Im able to relate to them? &quot;Hey dude, <span style="display: none;" id="review7973">that fictional, animated girl on the T.V just farted, so did I!&quot; Well I&#039;ll be damn.<br />
<br />
This anime is just screaming out the word boredom. Who on earth would want to watch schoolgirls talk about the different ways to cut food for five friggin minutes? Surprisingly, millions of em. Even after contemplating for a long period of time, I can not fathom why anyone would want to watch this. To be honest, I dont go for slice of life anime&#039;s but I am assured that this is an insult to slice of life anime&#039;s everywhere. We deserve better than this piece of ****.<br />
<br />
The animation and the voice acting is the only saving grace here. The rest are piss. The characters are shallow, comedy is not comedic, and lets not forget about how blunt the story is.<br />
<br />
School Rumble has nothing to fear from this destitute, brain-numbing show.<br />
If I were you I would rather take a brick, apply it to my forehead with force: Trust me, it&rsquo;ll hurt less than trying to make sense of this anime.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle7973" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="7973">read more</a></div>

		</div>In the year 2007 A.D., a fire was brewing in the Kyoto Animation studio. Fresh off the success of Haruhi Suzumiya and smelling of farts and ramen-scented body odor, the staff of KyoAni developed an ingenious plan to further milk countless wads of cashmoney from pathetic losers and pedophiles on both sides of the pacific: take a popular 4 panel comic series ripe with the elements that made Suzumiya a financial success (pandering to shut in weeaboos with lolicon action figure collections and terabytes of hentai) and turn it into an equally horrendous anime series. After spending tireless hours handcrafting only the stalest jokes, the <span style="display: none;" id="review37005">blandest artwork, and the most mindnumbingly boring scripts in Japanese television history, Yushiro Takemoto opened his anus and took a massive shit onto a nearby Tokyo sidewalk. Millions gawked at the magnitude of his feces: proportions this great hadn&#039;t been seen since U2 released the waterboarding-like torturefest that was &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; in 2004. Once Norwegian scientists had been given proper time to mass, perform tests on, and take pictures with said shit, Takemoto was told he needed to give it a name. He chose Lucky Star.<br />
<br />
Much like those gag electric shock pens you gave out to your friends as a prank in the 4th grade, Lucky Star tricks you into watching it under the guise that it&#039;s a &quot;comedy&quot;, but in reality it&#039;s less of a laugh-fest and more of an exercise in sadomasochism. Half-way through the first episode I was convinced that having to watch this must be the wrath of a vengeful God, intent on punishing me for my past missteps and failures. By episode 2 I had been reduced to a vegetable, as the show had literally sucked all the energy from me. By episode 9 this condition became chronic, as I had turned my once-lovely living room into a wasteland and my once clean underwear into a net for catching the diarrhea that seeped from my petrified asshole. By episode 16 I had gathered enough energy to attempt suicide. After a short recovery stint in the hospital, I was put on anti-depressants and bear tranquilizers, and sooner or later I told my therapist that I needed to conquer my demons once and for all and finish this series. He approved, but only on one condition: that I watch it with him present in the room. I tried to talk sense into him, but he insisted that &quot;he&#039;s seen a lot of things in his time, alot of them a lot worse than anything a Japanese cartoon could throw at him.&quot;<br />
<br />
He later shot himself in a Staples parking lot.<br />
<br />
To put it plainly, Lucky Star is the antithesis of entertainment. There is nothing funny, clever, witty, or remotely interesting about the show. Weeaboo faggots will desperately try to convince you that this series is a comedic masterpiece and a pinnacle of artistic achievement, but as the first five minutes clearly establish, this couldn&#039;t be farther from the truth. Lucky Star is only revolutionary in how much it&#039;s able to bore anyone that isn&#039;t a drooling fuckstick with social anxiety disorder---you will truly think that this anime transcended time and space to deliver you a universe-shattering kick in the nuts, unless you find Meet The Spartans type reference jokes funny and obviously pre-pubescent anime girls hot, in which case you will love this show like the fucking loser you are. Many have compared this show to Seinfeld because the two share a &quot;show-about-nothing&quot; approach to narrative storytelling, but this is where all logical comparisons end. Seinfeld is a groundbreaking TV series about the hilarious exploits of a group of really big assholes in New York. Lucky Star is a show about the various non-incidents in the lives of a bunch of &quot;this-is-what-weeaboos-wish-girls-were-like&quot; high schoolers that have dull-as-fuck conversations, fit neatly inside cliche archetypes without ever evolving, and make a lot of cringe-worthy pop culture references.<br />
<br />
But pure shittiness alone is not enough to propel this anime to the bottom-of-the-barrel status it&#039;s currently at. What really gets me about Lucky Star is just how much the &quot;FEED ME MORE MONEY&quot; attitude of Kyoto Animation leaks into the actual production. Every time I endure a painfully boring discussion about some every-day life topic, another unfunny Lucky Channel skit, the explanation and, in turn, ruination of what otherwise would&#039;ve been a passable joke, or some reference to Haruhi/[insert video game and/or anime here] it brings me back to the actual intended purpose of this series. The characters, situations, and jokes are all purposely written to be engaging to shut-in dorks who spend most of their lives watching anime, playing video games, and posting on internet message boards. It&#039;s the hollowest anime I&#039;ve ever watched; it soullessly and maliciously appeals to people who are too pathetic to realize that they&#039;re being pandered to for cash---if you paid money to see any part of this show and AREN&#039;T one of these people, you will walk away from the experience feeling like someone shot you in the knees and proceeded to steal your house, car, identity, and wife. It&#039;s an anime designed to be watched amongst anime club meetings filled with people who force out dry heaves of laughter so they can feel like they fit in with everyone around them, and on projector screens at anime conventions filled with freaks dressed up as animals and Sailor Moon characters. This show was not created out of passion, or a general love for the medium, or an actual belief that the show would be funny, it was created to exploit the lowest common denominator of anime fans for a quick buck. It&#039;s taking money from people who don&#039;t know any better, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and takes away any respect you might&#039;ve had for anyone involved in making the series.<br />
<br />
Lucky Star&#039;s art is sickeningly sweet moe-trash. For a studio that is clearly focused more on animation than story, the level of mediocrity shown here is unacceptable. At least when I watched that shitheap Haruhi Suzumiya I could compliment aspects where it was clear that an effort was made to produce a quality product---here, we have a prime example of the new-age, assembly style artwork that is plaguing modern anime. With our huge advantages in technology, one would think that the seemingly limitless possibilities would spark breathtaking results, and while we have seen glimpses of that (i.e. 2009&#039;s Summer Wars), most of what has prevailed in the industry has been streamlined, sterilized, and soulless.<br />
<br />
I do have to give the anime props in the sound department, however. The OP is probably the most engaging part of the entire show, as each time you hear it you will be pumped for what has to be the episode where the series starts to pick up. Although it never does, I can&#039;t fault the OP for giving us hope. The various EDs run the gauntlet in terms of quality, but overall they&#039;re a nice break away from the mouth breathing dynamics that are the actual show. As for the voice actors, they all came and turned out respectable performances, giving the show at least one bearable quality in between credits. This is one of the few anime that I watched subbed however, so I have no idea if the American VAs are any good.<br />
<br />
The fact that people say they can relate to characters on this show is frightening. They literally amount to little moeballs stuffed with every possible high-school girl cliche the writers could dig up, and never develop past that point. Konata, however, is not only that, but something much, much worse. While the rest of the characters seek to appeal to the section of the anime market that fawns over overt cuteness, Konata is an interesting look at how far an animation studio will go to squeeze money out of otaku fucks. She was created solely so weeaboos would have someone on the cast they could identify with, and keeping in tune with Kyoto Animation&#039;s opinion of their viewers, she&#039;s painfully one-dimensional. Her hobbies include video games, anime, and being a bitch. That&#039;s it. Unfortunately, not much else can be said about the rest of their characters either. Miyuki is the intellect of the group, but she&#039;s also moe. Tsukasa is the shy one, but she&#039;s also moe. Kagami is the fiery tsundere, but she&#039;s also moe. At the very least, when you give a one line description of Seinfeld&#039;s characters, you&#039;re leaving out a lot of character information. They may not really change as time progresses, but you certainly learn a lot more about them. In Lucky Star, one line descriptions define our characters for the entire show. There&#039;s more character development on an episode of Cops than there is here.<br />
<br />
As I reached the end of the final episode, I turned to my therapist who was, at that current moment, sobbing into my shoulder due to sheer, unfettered boredom. His bloodshot eyes looked up at me and as I looked down at him with a mix of pity and remorse, I could see his lips faintly whisper out &quot;save me&quot;. As the girls geared up their cheerleading performance of the opening song, I could see his last glimmer of hope, of faith in humanity, slip away from him and float towards the abyss.<br />
<br />
He thought he could save me.<br />
<br />
I refuse to believe that Kyoto Animation could, as they watched over the series for the last time before officially releasing it, say with complete honesty that this series was not only acceptable for public consumption but also legitimately enjoyable. It&#039;s possible to relish in a show&#039;s badness if you&#039;re able to respect the sincerity of the people that made it. It&#039;s why I love movies like The Room and Batman and Robin, and it&#039;s why I think Mars of Destruction deserves to be shown nightly on HBO. However, when something this bad is actually just a cruel joke at the expense of a bunch of weeaboo faggots, the insincerity of it all taints what could&#039;ve just been a run of the mill bad show and turns it into something mean-spirited and unlikeable. I don&#039;t think otaku realize that this show isn&#039;t actually celebrating the things they love, it&#039;s passive-aggressively making fun of them and their interests, and they&#039;re actually paying to have it happen to them in real time. Has this community sunk so low that even the people making this shit can get away with calling you all fucking losers? At what point will you stop yelling &quot;FEED ME MORE MOE GIRLS&quot; and start clamoring for real, quality entertainment? Don&#039;t you want to know what it feels like to laugh without having to force it out?<br />

		</div>Erm...So i have now re-watched it for second time...This is my first time doing something like that. Raki ☆ Suta! <br />
<br />
Story: Most common mistake people make is that they say Lucky Star doesn&#039;t have a story. It has! &quot;The daily lives of 4 high school girls.&quot; Understood? Good. Can&#039;t say much here, because of the randomness of &quot;slice of life&quot; genre. Still, I like how the story progress, except for the first few episodes which people usually don&#039;t understand what the series is about - which is director&#039;s fault. *shrugs* He got fired after the first four episodes anyway. If you think this story is <span style="display: none;" id="review1862">bad, wait &#039;till you see Mars of Destruction.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Art: Yeah, I know that the art is nothing compared to KyoAni&#039;s usual productions, but is far better than them in one aspect, cuteness. Anyone who have watched the series can tell that how cute Konata is. Most of the scenes aren&#039;t really detailed, you usually see the upper parts of the characters, but that doesn&#039;t change how well cuteness goes with Miyuki&#039;s &#039;ultimade moe-ness&#039;, Konata&#039;s children-like personality and Tsukasa&#039;s &#039;little sister-ish&#039; figure. BTW, background is detailed, proof (was) here, now destroyed with the absence of BBCodes.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Sound: This one varies a lot, depending on how many animes you&#039;ve seen. The OP is catchy, and goes with the cuteness of the anime. The different endings were a good addition to anime, but if you haven&#039;t heard the songs before, you may think that a single ending theme would be better. And for the second part of the EDs, Shiraishi Minoru does awesome job. You still may not know some of the songs sung by him, but just watching him is entertaining too. I love how KyoAni toys with their own songs. The sound effects and OST isn&#039;t really obvious, but I can say that how it goes with the flow and is &quot;cute&quot; really enhances the dialogues. Especially when Kona-chan is about to start saying a funny comment about Kagami, the way music stops right before it and you can guess it coming.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Characters: Probably you can&#039;t learn their personalities in just one episode, but as the time goes on, you learn more and more about their personality. Even in the second half of the anime where they introduce new characters, no character gets more screentime than another. If they do, well, KyoAni is sure to make a joke about them! They are so unique and easy to remember. OK, not really unique (Kagami as you typical tsundere and Miyuki as you typical moe) but they are unique in their own ways. No wait! According to Shiraishi, Kagami isn&#039;t tsundere! Oh well, I don&#039;t care about what he thinks. Kagami is tsundere. <br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: What can someone give this part anything besides 10 out of 10? Great jokes, mainly based Suzumiya Haruhi and everyday problems of the world and Japan. Again, if you haven&#039;t watched Haruhi yet, you won&#039;t be able to get even the half of the jokes. That said, if you have watched it, you&#039;ll probably love the jokes. Azumanga Daioh is pretty much the same as Lucky Star, both having jokes based on pure randomness. School Rumble is more romance oriented, but still on par with them. If I had to pick one of them, it&#039;d definitely be Lucky Star.<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: This series is a definitely a must-see for someone who has some anime knowledge and interested in slice of life/comedy genre. Lucky Star is a win or lose situation. Either you hate it, or you love it. If you like it, it will probably certainly be one of your favourite animes. If you don&#039;t like the slice of life/comedy genre and don&#039;t have fun finding all those references, I suggest that you don&#039;t watch it. Be sure to watch Haruhi beforehand, if you are going to watch Lucky Star.<br />

		</div>This is my first review in MAL and I&#039;m gonna use it on Lucky Star and to be honest, I&#039;m going to be pretty harsh on this one.<br />
<br />
I watched Lucky Star because I heard people speaking wonderful things of this anime and then I said I should watch it and see how it is. The pain, I couldn&#039;t stand it. Nevertheless, I tried to watch it and see if I could find something interesting but sadly I couldn&#039;t<br />
<br />
Story: Pretty poor indeed, because there isn&#039;t a plot. The anime only talks about the life of 4 high school girls... 5 later. There isn&#039;t anything else, other <span style="display: none;" id="review23263">than talking about their usual lifes, food, animes, videogames, etc. <br />
<br />
Art: The art was fine, I really liked the colors and how beautiful it looked but sometimes the art was bad in other parts. All I can say is that sometimes it looked great and sometimes it looked bad.<br />
<br />
Sound: The seiyuus were great, especially Konata and Kagami but sometimes some voices ruined the mood like almost all the sales clerk that appeared because almost all of them had the same seiyuu and that ruined it. The opening to be honest was pretty bad; the music was kind of bad and the endings... the only one I liked was when Konata sang Chala Head Chala but the other ones were bad, especially when they started to put real actors in the ending.<br />
<br />
Character: Hardly, there isn&#039;t a development there. The only thing that can be rescued is the fact of the interaction between Konata and Kagami but after all everything is dull. Let&#039;s put it this way; Konata is your typical otaku, Kagami the tsundere, Tsukasa the shy girl and Miyuki the one that is the intelligent. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Bad, pretty bad. The anime is supposed to make you laugh or relate yourself to one of the character; I couldn&#039;t do that. The jokes and things that happen didn&#039;t amuse me at all and the characters the only one I could relate a little was Konata because she like me loves videogames and animes but that is all.<br />
<br />
Overall: This anime isn&#039;t for anyone. If you like anime with plot and character development then get away from here, you will never like Lucky Star. The anime itself isn&#039;t bad but as I said, it isn&#039;t for everyone. Some people might like it and enjoy the characters and the jokes that I couldn&#039;t get but for me, this anime is quite overrated; not even all the references of Haruhi could save it. </span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle23263" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="23263">read more</a></div>

		</div>I may be considered as a Lucky Star hater. The previous sentence is for people who click the &quot;Not Helpful&quot; button just because they disagree with the review instead of how well constructed the review is; I do not wish to waste their precious time as inhumane and insensitive beings to destroy other people&#039;s lives as reviewers. Even if I do talk about the good aspects of the work that I enjoyed, I expect about 10 of 1,500 people to find this review helpful so Lucky Star fans, make me proud. To everyone else considering this show and reading reviews because of how well-constructed they <span style="display: none;" id="review50957">are, I implore you to continue reading.<br />
<br />
I am a big fan of slice-of-life shows. It is a genre that plays with the mundaneness of life and family; there is very little concrete story and shows tend to be driven either by comedy, moe, or relationship dynamics. Lucky Star is not a slice-of-life show, but a show that panders to otakus with a considerable amount of fanservice and random anime references that makes Family Guy cry in his bed and call for mommy. I do not wish to call such works terrible just because they do that; Pani Poni Dash does this as well and it&#039;s way funner to watch even if you don&#039;t get all the references because it feels like a sitcom. Lucky Star is not a sitcom.<br />
<br />
The show itself is inconsistent. Episode 1 is infamous because it is plain boring. In the Studio Shaft anime, Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei, the characters criticized episode 1&#039;s coronet scene for just being plain boring. Episode 1 is almost unwatchable. It makes FLCL&#039;s quotable line, &quot;Nothing amazing happens here. Everything is ordinary.&quot;, feel so true with the anime medium. People who plan to watch this show should note the actual work only starts at about episode 2.<br />
<br />
Other episodes involve the &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; mantra. I&#039;m pretty cool with this -- as I said, I&#039;m a big fan of slice-of-life works --; however, the main character cast is almost a letdown from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Konata, played by Aya Hirano, references to Haruhi and other famous shows from the past. If you know Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star and Initial D, then you are in luck. Most people don&#039;t; however, this show can still be watched without knowing the references. It&#039;s just that you&#039;ll be missing 80% of the show&#039;s &quot;appeal&quot;, unlike Pani Poni Dash&#039;s which only amounts about 40%.<br />
<br />
Kagami is a tsundere who plays the straight man role. Tsukasa is moe and clumsy. Miyuki is moe and smart because she has glasses. If we judge them by character models, I think they&#039;re all pretty cute. As characters, they are terrible, bland, and boring. They don&#039;t offer a lot of interesting dynamics and they just feel flat as characters. Miyuki is one of the worst flat characters, changing very little throughout the show.<br />
<br />
Other episodes fared better with the addition of supporting characters. I enjoyed the supporting characters more than the main cast. Konata&#039;s dad, Izumi, is a perverted man who enjoys taking pictures of little girls and often asks his daughter to find the flag to get into the h-scene in eroges. Anime Tenchou is one of the most memorable characters and his over-the-top antics leave something to desire in the show itself. Akira Kogami&#039;s and Minoru Shiraishi&#039;s dynamics are just fun to look at; I look forward to their Lucky Channel segment a lot.<br />
<br />
There is an episode that I remember being actually good. It&#039;s about Konata&#039;s mother. To me, that&#039;s actually pretty good slice-of-life drama. Why the show doesn&#039;t follow this formula of success and go into moe pandering confuses me.<br />
<br />
While I am negative about the characters, the modeling as I said are great. The puni plush style is gorgeous and the backgrounds, as expected from KyoAni, are beautiful and photorealistic. If I view this as an art piece, it might get a B+ from me.<br />
<br />
The OP is one of those catchy atrocious tunes; the lyrics make little sense at all. Animation in the OP is pretty dynamic and wacky, unlike the show itself. I&#039;m more of a &quot;meh&quot; when it comes to the OP.<br />
<br />
To call the show polarizing is an understatement; it&#039;s either a show that you love or hate. I am clearly at the &quot;hate&quot; part, but I see some good aspects of the work. However, there are too many problems that causes me to dislike and hate the work. I admit that this work is influential, but for the wrong reasons. People should not just watch for the work&#039;s influence, but whether they enjoyed it or not. That&#039;s how you rate and review a work.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle50957" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="50957">read more</a></div>

		</div>Allright folks, first review on MAL. Lucky Star surely doesn&#039;t deserve this honour at all, anyway, here I go.<br />
<br />
Woah. I watched the first episode today (6th of July), but I have to say that it&#039;s maybe the most annoying, boring and useless anime my poor eyes have ever seen. This anime is simply horrid.<br />
It made me sick after 5 minutes (opening theme included), and I&#039;ve dropped it at the first episode. It actually never happened to me before. I guess there&#039;s a first time for everything.<br />
<br />
The OP, its lyrics, the characters, the dialogues, everything is just too stupid to bear. Even a decent (if you <span style="display: none;" id="review6038">dare to call a moeblob thing decent) art is completely useless with an anime like Lucky Star.<br />
<br />
After only 1 episode, I felt like some of my precious neurons died, so I&#039;ve stopped quickly.<br />
A whole episode talking about how to eat food (more specifically, a chocolate cornet)? Now if you excuse me...<br />
1) I already know how to eat, since I&#039;m not retarded like Konata.<br />
2) I have many better things to do.<br />
3) I prefer sushi.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no character development. At all.<br />
The whole episode is absurdly boring.<br />
More than slice of life, it&#039;s a slice of cake.<br />
And, the worst thing is, it&#039;s supposed to be a comedy, and it&#039;s not funny. Not in the slightest bit.<br />
Is Lucky Star supposed to make you cry from laughing? Yes, you&#039;ll cry, but only due to extreme boredom from watching this pathetic anime.<br />
<br />
Everything would be better than watch stupid 17yo girls (who look like 8yo to please the lolicon audience) that do nothing except talking, and talking, and talking in an awfully annoying and inconclusive way about the most superficial topics ever heard. I&#039;ve had way more fun with watching my cat sleeping.<br />
<br />
Lucky Star is the umpteenth anime that proves how the masses are blind towards the quality of an anime and how they always follow the cute (?), frivolous, random fashion that is currently on the top of the list.<br />
An advice for you guys: go watch a REAL anime. Don&#039;t waste your precious time with this retarded moeblob KyoAni parade. Want an actual funny anime? Watch Excel Saga. Watch Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. Watch Shin-chan. Watch everything but Lucky Star.<br />
<br />
And yes, I know everyone&#039;s going to hate my review and hope I&#039;ll burn in hell for writing this about the best anime ever made (...yes...sure...).</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle6038" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="6038">read more</a></div>

		</div>Overrated is the word that best describes Lucky Star. The animation is terrible for 2007 and the story is slice of life to the extreme; in other words boring. It&#039;s either a love it or hate it anime, but how can one like such a stale story line? <br />
<br />
The animation/art is very lazy and the lines are jagged. Kyoto Animation has up to date animation but &quot;Lucky Star&quot; looked like there wasn&#039;t effort put in. The people in the background are usually grey keyholes, and sometimes have faces but aren&#039;t animated. The characters are, yes, in high school despite looking like they are eight. The <span style="display: none;" id="review658">palette is extremely pastel while the colours almost blend together. The only time the animation was astounding was in snippets of video games/manga/anime etc.. <br />
<br />
The characters are cliche and aren&#039;t developed. There&#039;s the perfectionist who gets high marks and is very Type A. There is the shy, clumsy girl who likes to cook. There is the glasses girl who is well mannered. And, the lazy girl who plays video games doesn&#039;t put effort into homework but gets above average marks. Stereotypical characters. The design on three of them are cute, but if one is looking for cute characters in anime he or she should watch anything by CLAMP (Card Captor Sakura, Chobits) or the queen of kawaii, Koge Donbo. (Di Gi Charat, Pita Ten) There needs to be substance to cute characters and CLAMP and Koge Donbo proves it.<br />
<br />
The story, as mentioned before, is very plotless. Napolean Dynamite may have proven stories without a plot can be entertaining, but Lucky Star doesn&#039;t prove that theory. The first episode the characters are taking about how to eat food. First episodes usually aren&#039;t the greatest in the series, but when the writers start off with a boring story one can get a clear picture of how the lack of plot is present in this anime. Also, first episodes are meant to encourage viewers to keep watching not bore them. Usually scenes to shows are no more than two minutes to keep things moving, but &quot;Lucky Star&quot; is at a snail&#039;s pace. It&#039;s episodic (each episode is different and not chronologically) which suited the show and added to Anime since most is thematic. (Each episode is connected) and  There are some jokes thrown in here and there as well as cameos to other anime/video games, but it doesn&#039;t save the storyline. <br />
<br />
The random dancing in the opening is the only thing good about this anime.  If the show were to be animated well the random dance would have been more enjoyable. The opening music killed the amusing random dancing. It sounded more like owl&#039;s hooting a rap but inhaled too much helium. Though, there is a middle part (the only real singing) that is interesting. <br />
<br />
The actors suited their roles and fit their personalities. They even hired the same actress who did Haruhi in The Melconcholy of Haruhi Suzumiya as one of the characters, which fit the Haruhi cameo. They had high pitched cartoony voices for the appropriate roles which suited the show. <br />
<br />
You must count your lucky stars while watching this anime in order to enjoy this anime.  It&#039;s slice of life to the point where it&#039;s boring and leads nowhere. Watch the second episode (as mentioned the first is a disaster) to see if it amusing, which it isn&rsquo;t. Lucky Star doesn&#039;t offer anything to the table and can be easily passed to save one minutes of being wasted watching this anime. It may have gotten better but who wants to waste 10 episodes to get to the good stuff?<br />

		</div>What happens when you combine my favorite genre (Slice of Life) with my favorite studio (Kyoto Animation)? You get Lucky Star.<br />
<br />
Story: Normally when I score story in a Slice of Life show, I do it based on all the episodic stories combined. But what happens when a show does not have that and is just pure life and is random with no coherent order/story. That is why I left the score a blank. <br />
<br />
But I would still like to talk about the content. Lucky Star plays off its humor through normal everyday conversations. Talking about the most random things and finding humor out of it <span style="display: none;" id="review877">is tricky. Personally, I found most conversations hilarious because I enjoy the idea of everyday situations being made fun at. This type of humor is not for everybody and thus why this show can be a hit or miss.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of this show is its use of references. A good amount of conversations play off such references. And they can go anywhere from other anime to current events. It went as far as to use an old commercial. One of the keys to be able to enjoy this anime is to be able to know the references. Watching as much anime as I do, I got most of them easily.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: Technically speaking, this is not KyoAni&#039;s best work. But the style and design works really well for this type of story. There are times where I felt that they were being very lazy and yet there were times I was marveled at the level of detail. Of course it is nowhere near the level of their other works such as Haruhi.<br />
<br />
Sound: Voice - Everyone plays there roles really well. I was  particularly impressed with Hirano Aya (voice of Konata). KyoAni really utilized her vocal range and made great situations out of it. <br />
<br />
            Music - To me, this is probably the weakest aspect of the show. The OP is indeed catchy but it can only be appealing for so long. And the &quot;different&quot; ED each week was a hit or miss. The only great part about it was the appearance of Minoru Shiraishi. Having him sing for the last part of the series was brilliant. Listening to him was a blast. <br />
<br />
Character: Perhaps the strongest aspect of the show. The cast of Lucky Star are great. The variety it has and the way they fit so well together really bring out the show. Whether you come to like this show or not, I believe there will be at least one character that you can&#039;t help but like. Rather than me telling you, I hope you go check out this show after reading this review and see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment = My score on MAL (it is subjectively rated)<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a very enjoyable show. But it is for those who are into those kinds of humor. It is not something I would recommend to everybody. I believe this show is one of those shows where it is a hit or miss.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle877" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="877">read more</a></div>

		</div>I found this anime very difficult to get through. The comedy wasnt exactly funny, and the jokes and puns were more like <br />
&quot;oh, i relate/understand that, is my life also considered sad?&quot;<br />

using the rating breakdown, let me explain to you why I didnt find this anime particularly wonderful.<br />
<br />
STORY: there was almost no storyline. Sure 4 girls are trying to get through high school. but that sums up every other anime out there, about kids at school. What this anime lacked was drive. Plot is one of the elements which create the drive, but there was none. Im giving the story a 5 just for the <span style="display: none;" id="review1501">sake of the somewhat cleverly placed jokes. As well, many of the elements got tiring and old, such as Lucky Channel, which is a talkshow hosted at the end of each episode. The live action scenes at the end of the latter episodes also got extremely annoying and exploited.<br />
<br />
ART: nothing spectacular. I understand that for this kind of show, beautiful art isnt exactly the most neccessary thing. However, a lot of the time, there was no background. <br />
<br />
SOUND: sadly, there was hardly any background music. But the sole reason that I rated the sound so much higher than the other qualities is because the OP was just so amazing and addictive. Sadly, the energy and excitement of the OP could not be reflected into the show.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: The characters presented are all very different, and their interactions with each other are very amusing to watch. I would have liked if there was at least some character development, or at least some insight into the characters. Often, characters also give an anime series the drive it needs to go on, but there was nothing about the characters that made you want to know more about them.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: I must say that the enjoyment factor, for me, especially, was quite low compared to many other people. This show was extremely hyped, and many many people were saying how amazing it was, and how funny it was. When I watched, I was extremely dissapointed. I even sat the series through to the end to see if I was missing something, or if the &quot;amazingness&quot; came later on. it didnt. <br />
<br />
Most of the anime I enjoy watching has some substance, and there are factors like plot and characters that make me want to keep watching it. Lucky Star didnt cut it. <br />
<br />
If you also prefer animes with more substance, themes, plot, and character, I do not recommend Lucky Star.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle1501" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="1501">read more</a></div>

		</div>My review.. I&#039;m not really trying to say you shouldnt  watch this anime, some people like it, some people don&#039;t. But on my opinion i think this anime is as boring asd you can get. The sound is ok really cute and funny, that i can&#039;t complain, but the art.. some people say its cute and simple, i say its way too simple and not that cute to be honest, i&#039;ve seen much cutter characters such as chibis and so. The storyline.. I really think thats the worst part in it, i firsts started seeing this anime because it was kinda cute, i was <span style="display: none;" id="review16158">told that Konata was exactly like me, so i went to see it, very amusing at first, but as it goes on.. it turns to be a REAL drag.. Its basicly always the same, school, home, shoping, konata bein all about videogames, anime and manga, kagami arguing with konata, tsukasa stating the obvious with konata and miyuki being the smart girl there.<br />
Its basicly nothing new, always the same in each episode, and to be honest, the anim aint really that funny.. It rarely makes me laugh, and its not that i have no sense of humor or that i never did those experiences! I do have sence of humor and i had most of those experiences. But seriously i don&#039;t see whats funny about it, but that my opinion anyways, of course we all dont share the same opinion and i respect otherts opinions. But this is how i see things, and i reall. i dont think this anime is worth the ranking it has..<br />
<br />
Even a friend of mine that loves cute animes and such, like Shugo chara and Suzumiya Haruhi, she started seeing lucky star and enjoyed it, but has she went on she just said: Man you were right.. ._. that anime is cute and all but its making me so bored, ill see it later when i have the guts ^^&#039;<br />
<br />
One more person saying the same as i.<br />
<br />
I think the only good aspects about the anime are the sound and the characters, like you all say, gotta love Konata X)<br />
<br />
Anyways this is just my opinion! Don&#039;t blame me im not a lucky star hater &gt;.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle16158" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="16158">read more</a></div>

		</div>I&#039;ve gotta hand it to you Lucky Star haters, you cease to amaze me. No, I&#039;m not some illogical retard who loves Twilight or crap like that, I&#039;m pretty much one who has logic, in all seriousness I love logic. When you see me posting illogical stuff and me not admitting it, then I was either a) trolling or b) being drunk (I tend to lose myself when it&#039;s really late or really early in the morning but not drink beer drunk).<br />
<br />
I wanted to write this review because I was just overwhelmed seeing people who hate Lucky Star just because of their whorish fans. I <span style="display: none;" id="review15915">know some of your friends keep bitching to you how epic win Lucky Star is and that you MUST, NO MATTER WHAT MUST like Lucky Star but hey I won&#039;t force you, I&#039;m just here to tell you,&quot;NOT ALL LUCKY STAR FANS ARE RETARDS, HENCE STOP STEREOTYPING US.&quot; That&#039;s all.<br />
<br />
Now I won&#039;t go in the real scoring method (other than for the review itself) of discussing stuff one-by-one but rather, I&#039;ll try to argue with the haters&#039; views, call this review some kind of liaison for those of you haven&#039;t watched and those who have, loving it or hating it, I assure you I won&#039;t get biased.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s get to the most criticized part that I think is getting RIDICULOUS amounts of criticism: THE PLOT. Alright, how many slice-of-life anime shows have no plot? Seriously, a criticism you come up with IT HAS NO STORY LAWL! I&#039;m not trying to offend you, not at all (and I swear I&#039;m not being sarcastic) but that&#039;s ridiculous. I&#039;ve seen lots of anime shows with no plot and I still liked it. Plot or no plot, it&#039;s EXECUTION that matters. A game with excellent plot but poor gameplay would probably result in the gamer only finishing it once and not ever again just because of the plot (considering that the gamer likes storylines that is) but a game with poor plot but excellent gameplay would be re-played numerous times like what I do with Devil May Cry 3.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if this were not a haters-vs-lovers review I&#039;m making, I would rate the plot as -/10 because it&#039;s almost non-existent (aside from daily lives) and usually I won&#039;t even judge the plot of animes which don&#039;t have any solid plot in the first place. What the hell is useful in judging something that&#039;s not there? Shows can concentrate on many points: some concentrate on action (hence, art and maybe storyline), some can go on plot stuff (hence, THE PLOT) and some can go for humour (hence, execution) or even slice of life (which is usually based on how well you can relate to it). If you fail to get the premise of my words in this paragraph, you fail it and I&#039;ll say to you,&quot;Go away, you&#039;re not worth reading this thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#039;s simple logic really. But to be fair, since these types of Anime (about daily lives of people) are usually just that (aside from some Animes like Honey &amp; Clover which explores far deeper into their lives, making even more sub-plots) I&#039;ll give it a 6.5/10 in the review, rounded off to 7. They should have some kind of decimal rating stuff here =_=<br />
<br />
Also, since it&#039;s similar to a sitcom where you start off here and end at the same place you started, some may dislike it but I don&#039;t really mind. I just feel that instant liking to the characters.<br />
<br />
Then the art, yeah people have different opinions. I can&#039;t say much. It&#039;s really love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing so I won&#039;t criticize either side for their respective views on this, although I realize that it&#039;s purposely acting cute and aiming to be highly-loli-like for teh lulz, some people just won&#039;t take this crap &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
I like the moe and cute art so I give it an 8 here. Yeah call me biased and loli, I won&#039;t care when illogical people call on me for no reason at all.<br />
<br />
The sounds, ALSO love-it-or-hate-it. I actually liked the OP song and ED stuff that were sing by Minoru Shiraishi (especially ep 13, 17 and 22) and the soundtrack sounds quite nice. It fits in with the flow and the atmosphere, which is hands-down relaxing. It&#039;s a no-brainer that there won&#039;t be any epic soundtracks coming from here. I also like the soft OP that was transitioned into an instrumental at Ep 24. If you&#039;d like to compare this anime&#039;s OST to, say.. being fair in the slice-of-life genre, Honey &amp; Clover, after some consideration, is comparing a more variety-rich soundtrack in melancholy and whacky pieces (H&amp;C) with a more cheerful and light-toned soundtrack suited for a happy life (LS). I give it an 8. It&#039;s excellent at its very best which I more or less expected with its soothing soft music and some great ones. I&#039;d actually recommend you getting this if it weren&#039;t for those 10+ BGM CD&#039;s that you&#039;d have to get to get them all. Troublesome really, most soundtracks are in 1 CD but this is different =_= feels like they&#039;re cashing in or something. With Minoru Shiraishi and the different Character songs, I give this probably 8.4 after more exploration. I couldn&#039;t give this an 8.5 or else I&#039;ll be rounding off to a 9.<br />
<br />
I recommend the whole BGM soundtrack to be honest and maybe 100% nai nai nai on Kagami&#039;s Character song. Maybe it&#039;s just my taste but I honestly think it&#039;s one of the better than most other songs there. Again, people&#039;s tastes differ in art so nothing to talk abou here.<br />
<br />
The seiyuu wasn&#039;t all that bad but with so many people having lots of different preferences I can&#039;t criticize this point much. Like people say, different people have different opinions, or as one of the anime title say,&quot;10 people, 10 colours&quot; which means different people, different minds. I&#039;d like to give the seiyuu a 8 though, seems like the main cast&#039;s voice fits too perfects and I feel I sense laziness from some departments but then it&#039;s not really annoying or really for the comedy (e.g, most of the extras sound exactly the same).<br />
<br />
Onto the characters, I can see how people can dislike Tsukasa, Miyuki and the other side characters but it kinda strikes me how people seem to think that we love Konata simply because she&#039;s loli + otaku thus loli otaku thus INSTA-WIN! Or some sort. I, for one, simply love Konata because I actually am like her. I love to procrastinate (but it&#039;s slowly going away :D), I love games to death (up to the point that I don&#039;t sleep for 31 hours), I love anime too. The similarities make me relate to her in so many ways and being a younger brother, it was interesting to see how she felt being like an older sister, maybe I&#039;ve never really seen that in my brother before.<br />
<br />
Not sure how people hate Konata. Probably they hate her just because other Lucky Star fans who are whores (there are people like these the same way there are Twitards [Twilight Retards]) keep persisting and bitching that she&#039;s the best character in the world. Whatever, if you&#039;re a hater, here&#039;s an advice: they&#039;re idiots, don&#039;t listen to them. AT ALL.<br />
<br />
Kagami is your typical tsundere but less of the slapstick tsuntsun or stuff like Louise or Taiga who are world-famous tsundere champs. Honestly I find her character great. She&#039;s the responsible type, hell if I will, she&#039;s Tohsaka Rin a la Lucky Star. She just socializes more with these friends than Tohsaka Rin from FSN does and honestly Kagami teases people less than what Tohsaka does and is more open than she is (sadly, if you don&#039;t know her, then you could ask around, she&#039;s like a common house-hold name in Anime these days &gt;_&gt;). One of her main attractive features is probably her looks, her hairstyle and her behaviour + chemistry with Konata.<br />
<br />
Tsukasa, Kagami&#039;s younger sister is your typical moe, shy, cutesy-cute character who&#039;s the pinnacle of air-heads in Lucky Star. Yeah I can still see how people hate her. Air-heads like these are sometimes boring characters and honestly, I never truly loved her the way I loved Kagami and Konata so yeah.<br />
<br />
Miyuki though, I can get why people dislike her, again. She&#039;s the glasses girl - silent, not too out-going, caring, helpful, wears glasses, is clumsy - and the usual smart type. Over-used stereotype, I know so I won&#039;t be bashing either side for loving or hating it although so far I think I&#039;ve only criticized a hater. Tell me where I&#039;m wrong and I&#039;d love to ask you some stuff and for you to ask me some stuff so I can see why people hate this so much.<br />
<br />
I believe people hated ep 1 - 4 because their director was changed after ep 4 and it got a whole lot better in my opinion so I invite everyone who&#039;s just started on the series or have not started the series to watch till like episode 6 to 8 and after that episode I won&#039;t force you to watch anymore if you still dislike it since it&#039;s either a) it&#039;s not your thing or b) it&#039;s not your thing. I&#039;m not some whore who won&#039;t take the fact that people can dislike what I love.<br />
<br />
Then the conversations, although shallow, I can relate too. I&#039;ve wondered about many things that even this anime has covered and I love this feeling. I&#039;ve also talked with some people about stuff Konata and co. have too. Also different situations like opening a bag of chips for someone, blocking the straw opening so that the water sticks there and acting all immature and pointing to how cool it is (actually I went as far as going to my science teacher to ask about this, but that was lots of years ago), how I pull an all-nighter right before a test, etc and etc.<br />
<br />
The humour is also dependent on how your humour goes. If you&#039;re into the references and the soft humour stuff then Lucky Star is great but honestly, I find this series as a whole not that incredibly funny or Hayate no Gotoku!-like in anyway. It&#039;s pretty unfair comparing them in my opinion but hey it&#039;s MY opinion so who gives a shit right? It isn&#039;t YOURS so I&#039;m not bashing YOUR opinion unless you have a crooked and baseless opinion which I&#039;ve seen from the Anti-Lucky Star club who I&#039;d love to discuss with why they hate the series WITHOUT flaming or anything of the sort. I&#039;ve seen in their thread, some people posting that the show has no plot (explained), sucky art, sound and characters (explained) and their friends keep whoring on them and say it&#039;s the best show and if you don&#039;t like it = u fail. Well I&#039;m here to tell you, just like a motivator like Adam Khoo or Tucker Max or some sort of motivator guy, say &quot;NO U!&quot; to THEM!<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve got a friend who doesn&#039;t like the types of genre I like but I don&#039;t go around her and keep choking her to death yelling,&quot;WATCH THIS OR I&#039;LL KILL YOUR KITTENS AND HAUNT UR CHILDREN!!!!!&quot; or shit like that, honestly, if you have friends like that, then you should consider first, if your friends are SMART people or IDIOTS, which I think majority are. If they can&#039;t even get people have different opinions (autism aside), then they are complete fuck-ups, idiots, failure to logic, immature, etc etc etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Never listen to what other people like those say. Honestly, I actually follow some hypes (e.g Shakugan no Shana, Lucky Star, Zero no Tsukaima) my friends give me but after that I rely on MY OWN opinion, not theirs and my opinions are made from a base and that base is solid. Rarely is the base of my opinions a crooked one and if it is I&#039;ll freely admit it or if I&#039;m feeling like an asshole, I&#039;ll change ID and register a new user (heheh :P that was like years ago though).<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed the series and I don&#039;t care what YOU think. If you find this review helpful, then thank you very much, if you don&#039;t, then I don&#039;t blame you and I won&#039;t be cursing your name a million times, it&#039;s up to you. God I don&#039;t get why people care so much what other people think sometimes. You&#039;ve got opinions, I&#039;ve got mine and sometimes people just have crooked opinions and that&#039;s why I wrote this.<br />
<br />
I really don&#039;t find the point in criticizing an Anime that has no plot as a shallow anime that has no plot as if pointing out that those white lab rats don&#039;t have tails compared to normal rats which have tails thus the lab rat is a bad rat and thus we must burn in into the haet-oven.<br />
<br />
So, whatever the hype, don&#039;t trust it for this anime or you may get utterly disappointed. I followed the hype and I got what I wanted (well after ep 1 I was disappointed but things got better afterwards). If you hate it and you don&#039;t want to be convinced, then I don&#039;t care. If you hate it and want some discussions on why it&#039;s so damn popular, please do talk with me on the forums or any other place. If you love it, then so do I! Yeah all in all I give this anime a 9/10 for me but in general, for all of you, it&#039;s probably a 7.8 on average<br />
<br />
Although in my opinion Honey &amp; Clover runs deeper, into the more confused melancholy adolescent and that people may call &#039;pathetic&#039; and &#039;emo&#039; and &#039;self-loathing&#039; (irks me that they never ever felt down THAT much before in their lives, guess people have it luckier) and maybe even philosophical stuff, Lucky Star does not go that far and does not fail to deliver simple everyday things or zanier things but still make it interesting.<br />
<br />
To haters: simply put, any slice-of-life anime does not depend on plot. They depend on their characters and how much you can relate to them. OP does not matter, ED does not matter, what matters is how much you can relate to them and don&#039;t let any fangirls get the better of you and make you hate it. I&#039;ve always been trolled with Naruto by my friends but I shrug it off, who cares really? Honestly, my point is if you can&#039;t relate to it, then you won&#039;t like it. That&#039;s my view of what slice-of-life animes really should be like. Why do I love t? I truly love the Konata and Kagami&#039;s personalitie and chemistry. I can relate to Konata and Kagami the most too. I don&#039;t express myself that well and yet I&#039;m very much a Konata without the-- oh wait maybe I do act lazy. Really, to be honest, if you watch it from episode 6 and skip 1 - 5 you probably won&#039;t be lost anyway. P.S I AM NO LOLICON - I don&#039;t love them for their loliness thank you very much. Who ever said we love loli anyway &gt;_&gt;<br />

		</div>Lucky * Star is about highschool girls and.. ummm, well, that&#039;s about it. It basically revolves around the lives of four girls (later on, more people are given some time) and the random conversations they have.<br />
<br />
Story <br />
This series is not incredibly plot filled. Actually, there really is none. It&#039;s not even really character driven. This anime, however, doesn&#039;t need much of a story. It still works out in a cute way. However, the rating IS for story, and in all fairness, there really was none. I think this is a fair, if not quite high rating for what was presented.<br />
<br />
Animation <br />
The best animation is definitly <span style="display: none;" id="review924">in the opening sequence. Everything flows nicely in it, and it throws money around to give a flawless performance. Once you get to the actual show, however, there is basically no movement what so ever, save the talking. <br />
<br />
The art style isn&#039;t top notch. It is kept with the original 4-koma&#039;s style, but I still think they could have coloured it a bit better. Maybe make the girls atleast look more their age.<br />
<br />
Sound <br />
I did really like that opening song. Quite catchy. The in-show music was also fairly well done, aside from the fact that I didn&#039;t really notice it. The music just kind of melted into the background. That&#039;s the only reason why it&#039;s not higher on my rating. It was good, but nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
Character <br />
This was my biggest issue. The series had INCREDIBLY 2-dimensional characters. They did not develope, they did not change. We did no see any different sides to them. The closest to this was with Konata, and... whatever her name is. The older of the twins. <br />
<br />
This may have been alright, because this would seriously screw up the nature of the anime, but because of the 2-D element to them, I couldn&#039;t really connect to any of them. Except maybe Konata. I&#039;m a big nerd too.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment <br />
While I did have a few giggles, I did not either really like this series, or really dislike it. I can see why people like it, but I don&#039;t understand the overwhelming popularity. I was told it was funny, but it wasn&#039;t a comedy. It was slice-of-life. I was told it was meaningful. That was a load of bull. I watched the series with no expectations, and I ended it with none. I don&#039;t see myself rewatching this anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Overall / My Comments / My Feelings <br />
I know people will be angry, but it wasn&#039;t an overall amazing show. It has no story, the art was pretty boring, the sound disappeared, and the characters were 2-D. The only thing this series had that I liked was the otaku jokes. Other than that, I couldn&#039;t relate. Highschool isn&#039;t like this for me. Not at all. And I don&#039;t know people who are so stereotypical. I was a little disappointed, I think.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say anything but, sorry fans. I just couldn&#039;t get myself hooked. I atleast pulled through all the episodes, but it was becoming a little draining towards the end. I had no real drive to finish it...</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle924" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="924">read more</a></div>

		</div>Lucky Star<br />
<br />
Story (6/10)<br />
The story here was by far the hardest thing for me to rate. Being a comedy/slice-of-life type of thing, Lucky Star has no real &quot;plot-line&quot; or story. You could skip 5 episodes and still understand what was going on. However, the day-to-day goings and doings of the 4 main characters was done decently, and the variety of what they did was okay, so therefore I gave it a 6, which is fair/decent. <br />
<br />
One thing I have to say though: After episode 10-ish or so, things were really getting boring. Sure, what they did was different, but the jokes had the same principle, and <span style="display: none;" id="review7145">it was just all so boring and repetitive. Especially the stupid Lucky Channel. God, I skipped over that so many times. Because it was boring and... oh god. I can&#039;t even bring myself to go on. But since there isn&#039;t all that much plot, I can&#039;t sit here and elaborate on it forever, so moving on...<br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
Though I don&#039;t like Kyoto Animation all that much, the good thing about them is the animation that they do is very good (though I personally don&#039;t like the style all that much). Everything flowed nicely and there was never a time where I thought &quot;Wow, they&#039;re running low on their budget&quot; or &quot;Wow, they got really lazy with that scene.&quot; But I&#039;ll be honest and say I really did not like the art style. The characters are supposed to be 17/18 and they looked like they were 10. Some people may call it cute and chibi but I call it ugly and stupid.<br />
<br />
Sound (7/10)<br />
Another good thing about Lucky Star is the sound quality. Most notably the great job done by the seiyuu. Kudos to them for doing an excellent job. Other than that, the sound was nothing more and nothing less than decent. The BGM was fitting and non-annoying, the opening was cutesy and funny, but nothing special. The various endings were occasionally humorous but not a lot.<br />
<br />
Character (6/10)<br />
Since Lucky Star is a comedy, serious character development isn&#039;t exactly on its agenda. The characters were varied to some extent -- we have the various archetypes to fill, the tsundere, the moe blob, the smart/clumsy one, and the... otaku? However, this is as deep as the character gets. Saying you can relate to Konata because you also like anime/manga is like saying you can also relate to Miyuki because she is a high school student. There is no depth or development and the &quot;variety&quot; of characters only go as far as stereotypical archtypes that you can find in almost any other anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts<br />
Since the &quot;enjoyment&quot; part of the review is just a personal opinion, I don&#039;t let it affect my score. But needless to say, I did not enjoy Lucky Star. I can safely say I did not laugh once while watching this. The only reason I didn&#039;t give it a 1 is because despite Konata being a shallow character, I liked her for many reasons and it was almost some fun to watch her go about her daily otaku lifestyle among normal-ish friends. But a comedy without humor is like a cow with no spots. If you want to go laugh, watch Azumanga Daioh instead, a comedy with much more humor that you can&#039;t help but smile at. Lucky Star tried to bring us a cute and relaxing slice-of-life comedy and an otaku we can all relate to,  but in my opinion it utterly failed.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle7145" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="7145">read more</a></div>

		</div>For all the reviews that say &quot;Lucky Star sucks&quot; none of them really explain WHY it sucks, so I felt a civic duty to unravel the technical aspects of it&#039;s suckiness. So..<br />
<br />
What makes bad comedy bad?<br />
1) Overusing references<br />
2) Not creating any of your own humor (or even trying)<br />
3) Covering glaring flaws with pandering<br />
<br />
LS doesn&#039;t have comedy, it only has a bundle of references. For example - Code Geass in episode idontreallyrememberwhichone? There&#039;s no joke there, only a reference. Recalling a highly popular show which you know or may even love sure does bring a warm fuzzy feeling of familiarity, suckering you into a positive reaction. <span style="display: none;" id="review157283">But if you want to do a funny you must MAKE YOUR OWN JOKE FIRST. If you&#039;re going to do nothing but leech off other&#039;s people creativity at least try to do something funny with it, twist it, ridicule it, add sarcasm, anything! Cut-and-paste is not comedy, it&#039;s lazy money grubbing.<br />
<br />
To make things worse most of those refs are obscure reaching out only to non-classic shows, making it impossible to get half of these nowadays without using google while watching. And even then it&#039;s the same issue, not inventing comedy just relying on familiarity all the way. In fact it&#039;s obscurities go for  the recent shows because they&#039;re still fresh in people&#039;s mind (at that time), making it easier to manipulate the viewer into an emotional corner. Hell it&#039;s not about actually parodying some aspect of a different show in the first place, just putting in the popular material so it&#039;s recognized by the viewer (ahh that warm nostalgic feeling) and let&#039;s move on who cares. That&#039;s what you do when you have no talent and love the smell of benjamins.<br />
<br />
To maximize the effectiveness of the marketing stunt add some moe pandering with typical sol, since that&#039;s the target audience most likely to buy dvd&#039;s. And by typical I mean the static, unwitty, unrealistic, boring ass shit you saw in every other maken-ki or azumanga daioh. With loli bait cuz that sells. One might think &quot;slice-of-life&quot; would indicate some actual realism or life lessons. Oh poor naive me..<br />
<br />
So yeah it&#039;s a major failure as a comedy because it doesn&#039;t attemp any. It&#039;s not a parody because it doesn&#039;t bother to parody what it references. I&#039;d give it an extra point for that catchy jpop song but let&#039;s be serious here. A classic? Classic example of what greed can do to people maybe. In a way it indeed is a milestone - as it marked the beginning of brand new direction of abandoning all notions of creativity for the sake of pumping poor sods of their money clean. Good job helping the industry decline even further KyoAni, good job.<br />
<br />
Lucky Star is NOT a &quot;love or hate&quot; type of show, it&#039;s a &quot;either you get suckered in by the cheap trick or see through it&quot; type of show. It&#039;s bait anime - bait of your favourite shows references, bait of lolis, bait of otaku self-insertion Konata (imagine if instead a girl there was an obese smelly creep in front of a pc). Watching it in a year when all the obscurities it refers are well faded-out is the best way to disillusion yourself. <br />
<br />
Commercialism at it&#039;s lowest, laziest worst.<br />
1/10 <br />

		</div>Lucky Star is an anime that has no point, but to be amusing. Whether it&#039;s amusing is up to personal taste, but for me, it wasn&#039;t that amusing at all. <br />
<br />
Story: It&#039;s rubbish, and there&#039;s absolutely no plot to speak of. However, this is kind of the point of the show. In this case, story and plot doesn&#039;t matter as it was never intended to have a proper one, however as the viewer I think it&#039;s much more interesting to have a proper story and plot. It&#039;s up to tastes, but I still think it&#039;s bad. <br />
<br />
-1/10 for story.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: While it does it&#039;s job, it <span style="display: none;" id="review145473">doesn&#039;t blow you away with it&#039;s glory, nor does it make you want to vomit. It&#039;s bright and colorful, however I truly don&#039;t care for it. It&#039;s meant to be cute, and based on your preferences, you may find it to be. I do not, however the art/animation does it&#039;s job and is alright.<br />
<br />
-5/10 for Art/Animation.<br />
<br />
Sound: The characters all sounded cute and moe, as intended. The soundtrack? Nothing really stood out to me at all, and I found some of the tracks to be annoying. Only thing that really made a big impression on me was the opening, which was both amazing and terrifying. The sound did it&#039;s job and wasn&#039;t terrible.<br />
<br />
-6/10 for sound.<br />
<br />
Characters: Oh boy, here we go. Alright, characters in Lucky Star were basically clear cut character archetypes. Konata is the otaku, Kagami the tsundere, Tsukasa the quiet and shy girl, and Miyuki is the smart girl who&#039;s ditsy. With no development to speak of, all we have to go on are the characters basic archetypes. All in all? They weren&#039;t anything special, and were essentially just trying to be amusing, which failed for me.<br />
<br />
4/10 for characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This was just about the most boring thing I&#039;ve ever done, watching this show. I watched it because a friend suggested it, saying that it had references to other anime I liked and that I&#039;d enjoy it. And he was absolutely wrong. In my mind, Lucky Star is pretty harmless in that it&#039;s not terrible, but at the same time it&#039;s incredibly boring and I found myself drifting off and thinking about other stuff when I watched this anime, which is usually a bad sign.<br />
<br />
3/10 for enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Overall: Lucky Star is essentially just Kyoto Ani masturbating to itself, what with references to other anime they worked on in the show, or having creators of the show dance and sing for some of the ending credits. While not a terrible anime, it&#039;s not one I would really recommend, unless you like slice of life&#039;s that have no real point. In that case you might like this anime, as with anime like this it&#039;s all up to personal preference anyways.<br />
<br />
-4/10 Overall.<br />
<br />
Dub or Sub?: I typically watch shows subbed, but I watched this show subbed and dubbed on different episodes, and I can honestly say it doesn&#039;t matter. Basically if you prefer dubs, watch it dubbed, and if you prefer subs, watch it subbed.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle145473" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="145473">read more</a></div>

		</div>Story: There isn&#039;t really a main story, the series revolves around the daily life of 4 high school girls.  This series is based on a Japanese 4-panel comic strip, and as comic strips go, the contents can be just about any topics that come to mind.  Though there&#039;s no main story (people gets judgmental about this), people overlook the fact it is BECAUSE there&#039;s no main story, there&#039;s no restrictions to what the series can talk about.<br />
<br />
Art: The art style from the anime were pretty much the same as from the manga.  There wasn&#039;t any inconsistencies and the animation was relatively smooth <span style="display: none;" id="review869">the entire time.  The characters/backgrounds were drawn the way they are because...again...this series is derived from a 4-panel comic strip.<br />
<br />
Sound: The BGM blends with the episodes very well.  The opening song always got me pumped up to watch the episodes no matter what kind of mood I was in at the moment.  The ending songs were all taken from somewhere else and sung by the voice actors, and most of them were absolutely hilarious (especially Hare Hare Yukai sung by Shiraishi Minoru along with the 2 player fighting game training mode simulator).<br />
<br />
Characters: What&#039;s done so well about the character development is that you learn about the characters the same way you learn about someone in real life, from their casual conversations in school.  Even though this is a comedy, there are some dramatic scenes here and there showing some of the character&#039;s life at home.  There&#039;s also a wide variety of characters (who&#039;re normal and aren&#039;t golden haired, KI blasting, walking slabs of muscles) for the viewer to relate to.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I really like how this is a show that you can just pick up and enjoy without knowing the contents of the previous episodes.  There are also many references, so many that a normal person (who doesn&#039;t watch much anime or play games) wouldn&#039;t be able to understand more than half of it.<br />
<br />
Overall: The thing about Lucky Star is that not everyone&#039;s going to like it.  This show is aimed towards regular anime watchers/gamers.  Those who are not anime watchers will be confused at the references, older people may think it&#039;s plotless insanity, and younger people may not understand the jokes.  <br />
<br />
With that said, if you&#039;re an anime watcher (if you&#039;re taking time to read this I&#039;d bet you are), this show will be an absolute blast.  This anime is the KING of referencing, and with each episodes being a synthesis of small events, you&#039;ll never guess what could happen next.<br />
<br />
**Brief Warning**<br />
The first few episodes of the series may seem boring at first, but they&#039;re for introducing the 4 main characters.  No matter what you may think, keep watching, give it a chance.  By episode 10 or so, you will not regret sticking with this series.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle869" class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="869">read more</a></div>
