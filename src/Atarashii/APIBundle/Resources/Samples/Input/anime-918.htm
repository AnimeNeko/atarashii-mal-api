		</div>Over the years there have been a multitude of comedy shows that have graced our TV screens, from the surreal stylings of Monty Python and sarcastic wit of Blackadder, to the sci-fi tomfoolery of Red Dwarf and the strange antics of The Fast Show. There are numerous notable series that have taken their rightful places in our DVD collections, and in an age where comedians are treated like rock stars, maybe it's fate that comedy anime would also come of age.<br />
<br />
It's strange to say this, but humour has never been a strong department for the medium, partly because of the cultural differences between East and <span style="display: none;" id="review19816">West, but mainly because the majority of anime comedies rely more on parody than anything else. The problem with this is that quite often the viewer is left without a frame of reference, so the humour simply goes over their heads. Some shows manage to get away with it purely by throwing out an almost constant stream of gags in the hope that people will understand enough of them to be entertained, while others like Seto no Hanayome and Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu have a slightly more careful approach.<br />
<br />
The area where anime is weakest is where situational comedy is concerned. There are plenty of shows around that could invariably class themselves as sit-coms, but the penchant for studios to base their stories in some sort of school setting severely limits the quality of the humour. In essence, the industry's blind adherence to what they think is a winning formula has resulted in the dilution of just about every single joke that could be told in a school setting, so much so in fact that these days studios have fallen to relying on fanservice based comedies in order to make ends meet (pardon the pun).<br />
<br />
Comedy anime isn't dead though, as there are some rays of light shining down on the wreckage of red noses, bladders on sticks and giant shoes. Nodame Cantabile insane otaku heroine and her long suffering boyfriend introduced many people to the world of classical music and the usage of otaku power when learning French. Genshiken took a slightly rose tinted look at the multi-layered world of the Japanese otaku, while Moyashimon payed homage to the classic American frat comedy National Lampoon's Animal House.<br />
<br />
One series has, however, defied all the conventions, and has become one of the greatest comedy anime of all time. Incorporating elements from some of the best comedy of both East and West, the series has an anarchic streak that, at times, is more reminiscent of Monty Python, The Simpsons and Family Guy.<br />
<br />
I am, of course, talking about Gintama.<br />
<br />
The concept of a samurai sit-com isn't new to anime and manga, however it wasn't until the serialisation of Sorachi Hideaki's manga in 2003 that anyone actually realised the potential in this type of story. Set in a quasi-historical Edo, Japan (and possibly the rest of the world), has been conquered by an alien race known as the Amanto. The nation's strongest warriors were no match for the alien technology, and in an effort to prevent another samurai uprising, the powers that be have banned humans from carrying swords in public.<br />
<br />
In this world there lives a former samurai with silver hair who runs the firm known as Yorozuya from his rented second floor apartment. From time to time he takes on odd jobs (yorozuya), for people in order to pay his rent and buy milkshakes and his beloved Weekly Shounen Jump.<br />
<br />
He is Sakata Gintoki, and his destiny is to make you cry with laughter.<br />
<br />
To say that the story is a bit on the haphazard side is probably a gross understatement, however Gintama is nothing if not consistent in its approach. The underlying story is of Gintoki and his "friends", Shimura Shinpachi (an average human teenager with no real special qualities), and Kagura (an alien who looks human and possesses monstrous strength), as they go through their days doing odd jobs for people, getting into arguments/figths with the Shinsengumi (police, kind of), drinking strawberry milkshakes (or some other flavour depending on Gintoki's mood), and trying in some small way to make the world a better place.<br />
<br />
And that's really about as serious as many of the episodes get. The haphazard approach to the story is a purposeful measure that, strangely enough, works very well, mainly because Gintama is a comedy series. There are story arcs that occur over the course of the show, and even though they may include some serious or dramatic content, Gintama never once loses its sense of fun. Indeed, the comedy is the true strength of this series, not simply in its style and delivery, but also in its content. Many of the visual gags have to be seen to be believed (seriously, how the hell did they get away with the Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon), and whilst the series is top-filled with parodies, the humour is always involving so the viewer rarely feels like a joke has gone over their head.<br />
<br />
That said, Ginatama has one aspect that is greater than all others in terms of its plot and comedy content, and that is its ability to turn the seemingly ordinary into something completely different. This is the main reason why Gintama can be considered a sit-com rather than a parody, as this aspect has more in common with shows like Blackadder and Monty Python than anything else. There are numerous occasions where the series will catch the viewer off guard with its sly, anarchic take on seemingly normal events (like being in a public toilet and running out of paper).<br />
<br />
Of course, there are downsides too. Although the series is extremely strong in terms of comedy, it sometimes lacks when events take a serious turn. This may be due to the audience's reactions, as viewers may automatically think that something funny is going to happen next, however a part of it also stems from the fact that the comedy is sometimes too "strong". It's ironic to say this, but Gintama's greatest strength may also be its biggest weakness.<br />
<br />
As with any long running shounen series animation and design are pretty good on the whole. The characters convey a sense of visual individuality that at times goes beyond that of other shounen anime, although this is tempered with a small degree of genericism that allows the humour to flourish  . The colours are extremely bold and solid, while the backgrounds and set designs highlight the synergy between alien technology and Edo. The animation itself is of an extremely high standard, so much so in fact that some of the visual gags only really work because of it.<br />
<br />
The high points of the visuals are the show's numerous and well crafted parodies. There are many occasions where the style, animation, end even the character design, changes to make the humour more immediate, sometimes occuring in the blink of an eye, and sometimes lasting for a good portion of a given episode. The series also plays around with a variety of concepts that most people only really read about, one example being an occasion where Gintoki and the gang are rendered invisible because the episode is incomplete. It's nigh on impossible to find another anime that not only mentions something like this, but also shows the viewer what it would look like.<br />
<br />
Much of the humour comes from the characters themselves, but no matter how good the scripting is, delivery is everything when it comes to comedy, and in this respect Gintama is extremely well served by its seiyuu. The cast are able to perform with a panache that is sometimes astonishing, and their portrayals of their respective characters are so good that one would be forgiven for believing they were full time comedians. Possibly the best example of this is Kugimiya Rie (Kagura), who for many years has been typecast into various tsundere roles. Her portrayal of Kagura is truly excellent, especially in terms of comedy, and much like the rest of the cast she manages to not only maintain a consistent character for a an extended period of time, but has actually become more adept with her timing and delivery.<br />
<br />
Gintama is generally consistent with its choice of music, and certain tracks are repeated throughout the series usually to add to the comic atmosphere of a given scene. That said, some of the more serious moments can feel a little off-kilter as the score changes can sometimes be a little sudden. As with any long running series the OP and ED have changed since the show began airing in 2006. These tracks are usually pretty good at capturing the essence of  Gintama (which just sounds wrong), as a whole, and the opening sequences are designed and choregraphed to highlight the important aspects of the anime - humour, fun, some seriousness, and a large slice of anarchy.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, there is no real reason to find the characters outstanding, and the fact that they are iconic, original and memorable is possibly Gintama's greatest triumph. Gintoki, Shinpachi, Kagura, the members of the Shinsengumi, and all the sundry characters, alien and otherwise, who appear in the show will find some funny bone to tickle. When taken as individuals each is a flawed creation that really wouldn't work were this any other anime, but the plot and scripting for the series, together with the talent of the seiyuu and the design of each character, turns this idea completely on its head. Much of the comedy is dependent on the characters, and it's because the series is so good at entertaining the audience that any noticeable flaws are generally forgiven or ignored.<br />
<br />
Gintama is not simply a funny anime though. Over the seasons the show has gradually become a phenomenon in the medium, mainly because of its ability to maintain consistent humour for over most of its 201 episodes. The irreverent and oh-so anarchic humour can, at times, come off as weird, but this has only served to endear the series to more viewers.<br />
<br />
Numerous fans refer to Gintama as their "anime crack", a sentiment which is understandable in a sense as it has the ability to lift one's mood in a way that few other anime can manage. That doesn't mean that everyone will be entertained though, but if the viewer approaches the show with the right sort of mindset (e.g. open), then the series has a lot to offer.<br />
<br />
That said, shounen fans will definitely find Gintama appealing, not simply because it bears all the stereotypical hallmarks of that genre of anime, but also for its ability to creatively parody other shounen tales (like Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, etc - who can forget the infamous DragonBleaPiece movie trailer). Fans of comedy anime like Seto no Hanayome, Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu and others of that ilk, will also find Gintama's ability to mess with everyday concepts worthwhile.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of aspects to the series that possess a broad appeal in terms of humour, and it's to the credit of everyone involved with the production (from mangaka Sorachi Hideaki on down to the guy/girl who makes the tea), that the show never gets old, stale, or too bogged down in how good it actually is.<br />
<br />
There's a new king of comedy in town. Make way for Gintama.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle19816" onclick="reviewToggleText(19816)">read more</a></div>

		</div>Gintama? Gintama. Hmmm, Gintama... Gintama or not Gintama, that is the question.<br />
<br />
Now this is a show I've wrestled with for a long time. Many of my friends pledged almost fanatically this is the best anime in existence. I watched the first episode. So this is it? I was not impressed. As a person who found pleasure in the darkest and most gloomy kinds of settings, I would almost immediately say that this was not for me. Everything was just so weird and appeared to be arbitrarily glued together.<br />
<br />
I was so naïve.<br />
<br />
At some point I picked Gintama up again, I’m one of the people who are <span style="display: none;" id="review153409">not easily moved to laughter but still, there had to be something to this… Let me tell you this, Gintama is a journey, a pilgrimage. You will not appreciate it after two or three episodes, even twenty may not be enough. It took me sixty whole episodes when I was finally thoroughly entertained but it was then that I realized: Gintama is like a snowball rolling down a mountain. It’s barely recognizable at first but the next time you turn your gaze in its direction, it will have turned into an avalanche. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
Sooo… yeah, this is actually hard. Gintama is composed of a series of mini arcs that have no real connection to each other. You can’t call it a consistent storyline but it’s also not really episodic, there are also fillers organically weaved into the style and pace of the anime. A strange kind of hybrid, that still works somehow. We have different little events like the Benizakura, Yoshiwara or Popularity Poll arc, which all are amazingly done. Action, drama and most of all comedy, Gintama’s got them all and none of them are bad. Also, because I can’t find a better place to do this, let may tell you a few things about the often overlooked setting. The pseudo-medieval, post war Japanese capital Edo with modern technology, invaded by a multitude of alien races called Amanto. Sounds utterly random right? Wrong. It is my firm believe that this setting is actually the backbone of Gintama. Why you ask? Because it allows for the greatest number of possible scenarios, different people and places. You can have a samurai, a rebel leader, an alien and a penguin costume guy added to the cast and nobody bats an eye, because it still feels natural. Never forget the setting, it makes this anime what it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
It’s strange, when I started watching I thought to myself ‘This looks somehow generic’ but at the same time ‘This looks somehow unique’. It’s hard to explain but that’s the feeling I get from Gintama. Visual quality may not be top notch here but it gets progressively better, a fact that is especially apparent in latter battle sequences. I would leave it at nine points but there’s another thing… facial expressions. They are beyond hilarious, I won’t say too much about it but you will understand once you have seen a few exemplary episodes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
There are a few very iconic and memorable tracks on the Gintama OST, that’s probably due to the fact that they are used so frequently but that doesn’t mean that I ever got sick of them. Audio is mostly bright and uplifting, fitting to the animes focus on comedy. Opening and ending themes are also pleasing, notably Donten and Stairway Generation. This would also be a eight or nine if it wasn’t for the seiyuus. These guys are BRILLIANT! Every voice fits its character and Sugita Tomokazu is probably the most unique voice I have ever heard in anime. He’s now the voice of Gintoki for me, forever. Kugumiya Rie is a rather well-known name, revered for her roles as your run of the mill tsundere girls. Kagura was a kind of character that was probably new to her but she still did an excellent job. There are a dozen other examples but I’m not going into debt on all of them, only thing you have to know is that the voiceover job is amazing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
Alright, so this is the deciding factor that makes this anime awesome. Here we have some amazingly thought out characters and not just for comedy purposes, most of them have a backstory, even the vilest of antagonists are not just pure embodied malice. This is also what causes the anime to take time to get going, you have to get to know the characters. A naked random guy is very much different to a naked Isao Kondo. Almost all of them are likeable, memorable and most of all funny. We have no focus on development here but such progression would do more harm than anything else. It takes time to get to know them and that process is very important, changing a well-established character after that process is complete doesn’t strike me as a good idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
It takes time, 60 episodes to get it rolling, 140 episodes to have me almost dying of laughter but it was well worth it. Gintama maintains a consistent, no, increasing level of entertainment over the course of its 201 episodes. It’s already hilarious and would have been even better if I was capable of understanding the Japanese language without subtitles or if I’d seen more anime to understand all the parodies going on. Knowledge of basic Shounen Jump, Ghibli Movies, NGE, Doraemon or Gundam widely enhances the spectrum of jokes you can laugh about. Even without that and as part of a western audience, I found myself crying out in laughter over a majority of the jokes, there are just so many of them, no way you can miss everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Result: 10/10<br />
So are all these people right, is Gintama the best anime of all time? I dare not to pass judgment unto that, simply because Gintama is so unique and unconventional that I feel it falls into a category of its own. There is no competition for this anime in its specific category because it’s the only one that ever made it there. This is not the best of all anime, this is just Gintama, don’t lump it together with all the others! Even if they’re brilliant, if they’re entrancing, if they’re masterpieces, don’t make that mistake. I myself who is speaking so highly of this anime have other favorites; this is simply Gintama, no need for comparison.<br />
<br />
If you plan on taking a shot at Gintama and you’re not completely hooked after the first few episodes, bring a lot of patience, it will pay off.<br />

		</div>Gintama to be symbolized is like a bottle of fine apple cider. Its not the hot cinnamon one you enjoy at  winter time, but a bubbly and sweet drink enjoyed alongside some of the finest of your holiday wines.  Gintama is sweet. With a cast of bubbling and energetic characters who lift spirits. They just make the show sizzle with satisfying pops. At first Gintama feels like a kiddy drink laughable and nothing more. As you slow down and enjoy Gintama it becomes something more.  There is certain tartness mixed in, a hint of something more dramatic, this only materializes itself once <span style="display: none;" id="review113155">in a blue moon, yet you detected it. Its an edge darkness that only heightens the sweet bubble texture, it becomes a perfect balance of sweet and bubble with a hint of tart, resulting in something as great as the finest of wines . The over arching message of Gintama is to move on from the bad things and to work towards the good. Its to no matter what, through every trail and tribulation to live by your own “bushido code”. This is the morales of Gintama. Its 95% troll fun character shenanigans, 5% drama and dark morals. Yet, every bit of Gintma is a life lesson. Every episode and every title (some more troll than others). The fun episodes are meant to be enjoyed for fun. To tell you not to take life too seriously. The each drama arc is working through a hard time with respective values and morals. The fun episodes and dark episodes are both filled with pretty much the greatest comedy that the median of anime has produced. Using both mature and immature jokes, crude and clever, gags and satire, Gintama with comedy alone is a grand achievement. Yet on top it secedes in drama and truly great character interaction in a colorful world in which anything goes. This results in on of the greatest and most unique amines of all time (look at the damn scores).<br />
<br />
The story of Gintama is about Gintoki Sakata after aliens have taken over the earth and life has generally improved for the world. Yet, a nasty sword ban on the public has put the samurai class out of work. Gintoki must now leave the bloody past behind and forge his own new samurai code as he does odd jobs in the city of Edo(Tokyo) and barely get by.  Gintama is mostly comedy following along the ways of the odd jobs crew, each episodes and odd job generally goes around their own little life lessons, gags and stories. The series is very episodic. This takes 95% of the series as fun day to day shenanigans in a world dominated by weird aliens (So not really average by our standards). Under all of the tomfoolery is a dark feel. Gintama portrays this very well and sometimes the feel of the show can switch on a whim. Its  the 5% not in the “happy” this  is very well thought out drama arcs usually every 20 episodes, with lengths usually 3 to 6 episodes long. These arcs usually start softly, but usually end up serious and involve Ghosts from Gintoki’s past. This sense of past is never lost in the show, you always have a feeling that Gin cannot get over it.  It shows through continuously through his actions. Sometimes he stops when others laugh. He thinks back to his war days laughing with comrades and then frames back to his odd jobs crew and new friends; he smiles and joins back in. Gin has a very well hidden PTSD.  It mentioned by others, that he “has the smell of a beast to him” as when what he wishes to protect by his bushido code is threatened he’ll revert the “white demon” (nick name in alien wars) and risk everything life and limb to save what he cares about. This is a feeling that is constant through the entirety of Gintama, and in a sense this getting over the bad times and the past is the central meaning of Gintama as a whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
	Art of Gintama is very interesting, very inventive devices, vibrant color palates; the world also can turn dark very quickly. It creates a vibrant fun colorful world that shows its seedy underside. This makes for some great contrasts in animation and just the faces… so good.  From troll faces to deadly serious, to plainly confused, Gintama mastered the art of drawing facial expressions. The style in itself isn’t very risky and thus feels above average and not amazing.<br />
<br />
Sound is done by a variance of people. the Op’s and Ed’s are for a majority excellent. My personal Favorites from the 1st 201 episodes is the Op Donten with stairway generation being a close 2nd.  Osts are well-done; Madao is an excellent theme with slow guitar that makes you just feel.  Nothing though was completely off the walls amazing, but everything was great. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character truly is the greatness of Gintama. It’s a plethora of colorful bubbles that light up the world. Each with their own past they also want to leave behind.  The Main Main group is the odd jobs crew lead by Gintoki Sakata, and his two employees/ apprentices Kagura and Shimpachi + their beloved mascot Saduharu . The other best group is the elite police of this crazy world. The Shinsengumi, which is mainly Hijikata, Sougo, Kondo, and Yamazaki.  The odd jobs team is like a family always together and always on each others nerves, but help when the time comes, this has created the best friendship speeches in existence. “He owns me five bucks… so I can’t let him die”. The odd jobs crew gallivants around the city of Edo.  Gintoki a samurai for a new age, Kagura super strong and supper witty  young girl, Shimpachi the only sane man here. It truly is a treat to watch. The Shensengumi also gallivant putting anti government rebellions down with ridiculous police work. They have the daemon vice- chief, the sadist Captain Sougo, the bland Yamazaki, the lovable idiot chief Kondo. They also have their own serious arcs and frequently end up with the odd job team by total accident in deadly situations.  These groups with many colorful separate friends and characters make a colorful dish the compliments the totally colorful world of Gintama creating tons of funny moments, and some sad ones too.  The characters of Gintama make this wacky world shine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Gintama is a mastery of comedy and drama. Truly meant to be enjoyed slowly. Something to be savored for what it is.  Its not one to be taken too seriously or too lightly. Yet, it is a one of the greatest things to come to the anime median to date. Funny and heart warming, and sometimes just sometimes dark and gritty with a touch of feels.  If you take your time to savor it, Gintama is one anime that you shant want to miss.<br />

		</div>Gintama is a masterclass in comedy writing and variety; a series that grows in originality with each passing episode, so inventive and fresh, dynamic and interesting, it's no wonder it has become one of Sunrises' flagship series, not to mention a mainstay of Shounen Jump.<br />
<br />
The plot - from the get-go - perfectly encapsulates what Gintama is about: it's absurd. The Gintama universe is limitless; anything can and will happen. This insane nature is perfectly explored through the episode structure. Chiefly, it's an episodic series, with multiple story arcs woven in-between. Each episode will see a new plot, exploring one (or multiple) aspects of this wide <span style="display: none;" id="review12146">and wacky universe, along with the colorful and unpredictable cast. The stories range in genre, from thriller to flat-out comedy, but most have a humorous tone. Each episode is uniquely different from the next; they're brilliantly written, flawlessly executed narratives that fail to tire. The series displays a wonderful range of comedy, from parody to episode-long, painstakingly constructed, carefully executed gags; it's an ever-fresh and vigorous aspect and one of the series' many stand-out elements. The story arcs further explore the world and the characters of Gintama, some in humorous ways, but most in a more dramatic fashion, which adds further variety and heightened drama to the series. The diversity and imagination on display is hugely admirable, especially given the series' length. Gintama doesn't know fatigue; it stays at a consistent, extremely high quality throughout, with fresh new plot devices, scenarios and twists being continually introduced even years after its first broadcast - the writing is incredibly commendable.<br />
<br />
The animation and art style is ever-impressive; the anime staff seamlessly bring to life such a crazed, hectic and involved world from the pages of Sorachi's manga. The anime has a colorful, visually pleasing style, with flawlessly animated explosive action set pieces, heart-wrenching dramatic beats and eye-watering comedic reveals. The character designs are incredibly diverse and evoke well Sorachi's artwork, with Gintoki becoming an instantly recognisable anime icon.<br />
<br />
The sound and music is particularly well produced, with a huge amount of vocal talent on display. The score is incredibly elaborate and comprised of a vast variety of tracks, befitting of a series of this length. The backing tracks evoke well a number of different emotions, tones and moods, and blend seamlessly with the visuals, further bringing to life the world of Gintama. There are multiple stand-out compositions which are - above all else - memorable.<br />
<br />
One of the most appealing aspects of the series is without a doubt the characters. They're imaginative, memorable and varied creations, each unique and appealing in their own different way. The main characters present incredible amounts of enthusiasm and are the real driving force behind Gintama, but certain members of the unbelievably vast supporting cast are almost as integral in their own right. Sorachi's marvellous creativity shines through in the characters, just as it does the story, and it becomes obvious the anime staff have a complete understanding of the source material and an unwavering dedication to bring it to life. Given the gag-based nature of the series, the characters start off rather one dimensional, with little room to explore their background or the depths of their psyche in the episodic ventures, but the story arcs greatly expand on both the main characters and the prime supporting cast, developing their hearts and souls to a substantial, admirable degree.<br />
<br />
Gintama is a marvel, chock-full with everlasting potential. It's a series as side-splittingly funny as it is deeply heartbreaking. It presents a miscellany of different genres, tones, characters, scenarios, music, emotions and comedy, all blended into one exquisitely written, flawlessly executed, brilliantly produced, intelligent stunner of a series. It's among the utmost best anime has to offer.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle12146" onclick="reviewToggleText(12146)">read more</a></div>

SKET Dance creator (Shirohara) is a former assistant of Gintama's creator (Sorachi). It's therefore not surprising to see Sorachi-sensei's influence in SKET Dance. Comedy styles are similar.<br />

					<div class="spaceit_pad">A lot of people say sket dance is the school version of gintama, and that's kinda true.<br />
<br />
Main characters:<br />
Both have 3 main characters, 2 guys and 1 girl. In both of them a guy started their odd jobber group and the others joined later.<br />
<br />
Style:<br />
The envirement is a bit different, because in sket dance they are in a school and help studens with odd jobs and things like that. In gintama they are in a city were there are different orginizations and people they help ( Shinsengumi, Joi and aliens). <br />

Some characters in Gintama are voiced by the same seiyuus in Sket Dance (For example: Gintoki - Switch, Jugem - Himeko, Takaya Hachibei - Bossun). Sket Dance is like the school version of Yorozuya.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Other than the fact that one of the main character is voiced by same voice actor as Gintoki, this anime really does remind me of Gintama, but in an entirely different and refreshing set up. It was also very unique for me in terms of its take on high school girls, most anime I see show high school girls as timid and powerless or outright evil. The comedy is outstanding, there's never a dull moment. Don't give it much thought, just go for it. This series won't disappoint. &nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">They nearly have the same comedy sense, it doesn't have any arcs but its hilarious to the core. If you liked Gintama's way of comedy and the way that girl's are stronger than guys, go ahead and watch Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou! &nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Jokes' topics, episodic style and pure randomness make Daily Lives of High School Boys and Gintama quite alike in terms of comedy. As for die-hard Gintama fans, these animes not only share Sugita Tomokazu and Suzumura Kenichi, but also voice actors of Sa-chan, Zura, Kijima Matako and even the frigging Shogun! You'll definitely have some fun figuring them out.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">When i think of 'What similar to Gintama..?' I instantly think of Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou! Both animes have the same kinda comedy feel to them. They drop jokes in the same way too and they also kinda break the 'fourth wall' during episodes. The only difference between the shows would be Gintama is about Yakuza's and fighting while Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is about high school boys in their daily lives.<br />
Overall both animes and great and similar in many ways.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">The same sense of humor. Some scenes are totally random, characters have epic inner thoughts about ordinary things and sometimes have the same way of speaking. Both series are very funny and make you laugh out loud. <br />
<br />
Also you can hear a few seiyuus from both of these series. Hidenori is voiced by Sugita Tomokazu - the same goes for Gintama's main character - Gintoki. There's Suzumura Kenichi (DKNN - Yoshitake, Gintama - Okita), Ishida Akira (DKNN - President, Gintama - Katsura) and Kobayashi Yuu (DKNN - Yanagi, Gintama - Sacchan).<br />
<br />
And both are made by Sunrise. It explains everything.&nbsp;</div>

Danshi Koukousei no nichijou (Daily lives of high school boys) : Is simply as the title says. Three friends, high school boys, go through their normal, joke filled days in high school.

Beelzebub has more of a plot than Gintama which is based on various 3 to 6 episode long archs, which in no way relate to each other. However all the comedic aspects of the shows are similar. One of the main characters who cant actually do anything is just there to point out whats obviously wrong with the situation. A stupid main character who can be very EPIC when he has his moments.&nbsp;</div>

Also with simple understanding of the characters to their surroundings, Gintama and Beelzebub are simply hilarious.<br />
Beelzebub and Gintama also involves deep character development as well as hear-warming stories that mostly, always end with an amusing punch-line.<br />

Both have heroes who find are kinda lazy and find themselves in situations they didn't expect or want, but in the end there's no one you'd rather have at your side. You'll laugh, cry and fall in love with these animes&nbsp;</div>

Also, Kenshin and Gintoki have a very similar past, as both played a leading role in the ultimate Japanese Civil War and became legends; now, they want to leave their past behind and try to live a peaceful life, hiding their scars from the past with <span style="display: none;" id="recommend108388">a carefree pose.<br />

Everything they do from riding 2-wheeled transportation devices(I hesitate to call Gin-san's old scooter a bike) to nose-picking to ass-whopping make me think that they must be brothers from different universes. And if you liked GTO's awesome mix of comedy, action, life lessons, occasional ecchi, and problem-solving, then you should give Gintama a shot, because it is all that with a heavy dose of parody thrown in just for kicks.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="borderClass bgColor1" style="padding: 3px; border-width: 1px 0 0 0; margin: 4px 0;">
					<div class="spaceit_pad">compared to the anoying self centered gintama show with its uncharming sense of humour on thirds expenses GTO would be a clear improvement and many finely created laughs without any bad after taste. &nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Both are extremely funny.<br />
<br />
If you like one you'll most likely like the other.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Gintama may seem completely random at times only for comedy but when it gets serious its obvious these shows are alike.The similarity of the two lies mostly in the characters and their interactions.<br />
 They both have a poor excuse of a "adult" as the main character that just happen to be skilled fighters. As stupid as they seem their main point is the impact on other characters with cliche yet encouraging words of wisdom . And that is what makes them so liked by both characters in the show and in reality.<br />
If you like one you will definitely like the other :3&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="borderClass bgColor1" style="padding: 3px; border-width: 1px 0 0 0; margin: 4px 0;">
					<div class="spaceit_pad">Both main characters:<br />
*Act like scum.<br />
*Can do awkward things without shame<br />
*Epic speeches<br />
*Overpower pretty much all fights<br />
*lazy<br />
*scum perverts<br />
*have perverted scum fantasies<br />
*really really caring of their friends<br />
*everyone is drawn to them mystically<br />
*hopeless losers<br />
*dead fish eyes<br />
*make stupid ugly hilariously drawn faces<br />
*wear other anime costumes<br />
*prioritizes doing the moral thing over importance<br />
*both animes don't do cliched things to drag the story<br />
*makes you tear up when people discover the heroic things they did<br />
*great episodic arc stories<br />
*gets mad easily<br />
<br />
Whoops, I kept going on. Well you understand how much I love both of these.&nbsp;</div>
