		</div>“No one knows what the future holds. That’s why its potential is infinite.”<br />
Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)<br />
<br />
<br />
Such a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It’s one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it’s an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There’s not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.<br />
But why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
Steins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a “mad scientist” <span style="display: none;" id="review145393">who spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured – and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers’ attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either – in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
This is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn’t a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn’t jaw-dropping. However, this doesn’t mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible – and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Amazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
What can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There’s hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you’ll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Steins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don’t really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn’t refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime – but that’s not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked. So go ahead, you won't waste your precious time. In fact, you might want to go back in time to watch it again!<br />

		</div>"It's an intellectual drink for the chosen ones." -Okabe about Dr. Pepper.<br />
<br />
Well, where can I begin? Too many things can be said about this anime.<br />
I didn't play at the VN, so there some things that I don't know.<br />
Okay, let's resume the story first. All the review may contain spoiler, especially one part. <br />
<br />
Okabe Rintarou, also known as Hououin Kyouma, the auto-proclaimed mad scientist. That's the main character. His laboratory contains three members: him, Daru also known as Super-hacker, and Mayuri (Mayushii). In this laboratory, they developed what they've called "Future Gadget", all a bit strange, with epic names.<br />
At the beginning, they met Makise Kurisu, a <span style="display: none;" id="review189513">young clever scientist.<br />
One of the machine developed by Okabe is the phone microwave [name subject to change]. They do some experimentation on this machine. In fact, they discover something. This machine is a time machine.<br />
Here begin the story, a fight to change the future by altering the past, more or less.<br />
<br />
Now I'll explain one or two things that seem to be weird in my mind. This part contain spoilers.<br />
<br />
As a lot of anime, Steins;Gate put some rules. And he does it very well. For example, a D-Mail is used to alter the past, and it will have the following effect: changed the actual worldline. Okabe have the reading Steiner, so when we switch between two worldline, he remember all the things about the old worldline.<br />
To cancel the effect of a D-Mail, and so return to the initial worldline, they have to send another D-Mail, to the same person, and tell something opposite at the first D-Mail.<br />
Okay so here's the plot hole. At the episode 22, they have to cancel the last D-Mail, which is in reality the first one: "Makise Kurisu has been stamped". They do that by using the IBN 5100, hacking the CERN, find this message, and... Delete it by pressing enter! Here we are. How the action of deleting the D-Mail in the present can have effect on the past? It can't, if we follow the rules of the anime. I can agree that it change the future, but it means that Makise Kurisu should be dead, and the worldline shouldn't change. The fact that we see the animation that indicates a switch of worldline isn't logic, and it's for me an inconsistence.<br />
<br />
All others inconsistencies can be resolved in the way that it's an anime, and there's some things that we just have to admit. For example, I read on the net the following thing: when Okabe send the first D-Mail to Daru, we can’t know if the door of the microwave is open, that is necessary to get the effect of the D-Mail. Honestly… I don’t even care. We don’t see it, so I trust that Daru do some experiences on the microwave, and leave the door open. Who cares? <br />
But this one can't be resolved in an easy way as this. They put rules and not respect it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's why I put 8 to this anime, because it's the only thing that I was disappointed.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
From Okabe to Mr. Braun, all the characters are interesting in my mind. We have a great casting in this anime, a mad scientist, the girl who don't know anything about the science, but just follow Okabe (Mayuri), Daru which is more interested about 2D girls than 3D, Kurisu who is the little highbrow, and all the other are well defined, Suzuha Amane the "Part time Warrior", Moeka, ect...<br />
For example, when Mayuri see Okarin, she always said "tu tuluuu", and I found it so funny!<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Steins gate was published in 2010, and for this date the graphics are really good. And just the global graphics universe is... Wow I don't know how to said, but it fit really well with the theme of the show: a little bit dark when they are in the lab, even the street where the lab is, it's like the lab is a secret place.<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Here’s the black point. I think this anime is the anime the most constructed that I see. You can check all the dates when Okabe change worldline, it's coherent. You can't say that the story is bad. You maybe be able to not appreciate it, but don't tell me that it's a bad story.<br />
I don't put 10 because of this inconsistence that I underline higher in this review. And I think Steins Gate excels in the story because it's a really really big anime, with high budget. Every people have high expectations when they start to watch this anime. And there's only one inconsistence, and maybe, I search everywhere an explanation of this inconsistence but I didn't found one, but maybe there is one explanation.<br />
The more you make something with high budget, and well wait by people, the more the public will be exigent. And Steins gate satisfy a lot of people, so they did well I think.<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
I'm not really an expert about the sound in anime, so I just put 10 because I like the show. But I never heard a bad music when I watch it. The openings and the endings are also very good for me, so I have no reason to critic it.<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Even if I found a black point in the story, I really appreciate to watch this anime. It's one of the shows I enjoy the most. Everything is well constructed, and when I start to understand what's going on, you just want to know more things about it. There is a funny part in the anime, which is really really good because it give to the show a bit of humour.<br />
<br />
If I have one advice: watch it. You HAVE TO watch it.<br />

		</div>When dealing with time travel in story-writing, one has to look out for many things as such a topic is highly prone to having many plot holes due to being so vast and confusing but then also being so interesting. Steins;Gate takes on that very topic for itself, but does it manage to present itself in a way worthy of such a theme ?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story of Steins;Gate starts off a bit slow at first but doesn't take long to take off with a fairly complex plot filled with many twists and also presents the tale of the famous internet legend of 'John Titor' into the <span style="display: none;" id="review191971">mix as a large part of the story and manages to blend that with its own story in a great way. Nearly every step and action  is well thought out and one can not help but notice the amount of effort put into the execution of this show.. But, nothing is ever without its flaws as Steins;Gate does contain a few plot holes and might leave the viewer with some unanswered questions.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation:<br />
The art presented in Steins;Gate is well detailed and very polished but not anything too amazing though. The character designs are nicely done and the art-style fits the atmosphere of the Anime well.<br />
The animation is always fairly smooth, movements are good and character actions and expressions are animated well to bring out the personalities of the characters at their fullest.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The soundtrack of Steins;Gate does a good job at fitting the situations which further amplified the emotions felt by the viewer, the score was't exactly all that great all the time but did manage to get the job done when it needed to.<br />
The voice acting presented in this Anime is nothing short of amazing, especially when it comes to the main character. All the seiyuus/voice actors did a great job at expressing all the characters to their full potential and drawing out their personalities in the best way possible.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
This is the department where Steins;Gate shines the most. Every single character in the Steins;Gate universe is explored to their fullest. None of the characters ever seem bland, each and every one of them have their own personalities and are unique in their own ways . There is also ample amounts of character development as the show progresses and the characters slowly change as events unfold.<br />
<br />
Presentation:<br />
Steins;Gate manages to keep the viewer wanting more after each episode for almost the entirety of the show, although it did feel slightly repetitive during the second half of the show but that was a minor issue. The twists Steins;Gate presented were ever hardly predictable, it leaves you shocked every time and has you engrossed into the story even more. Some viewers though might be left with a few questions unanswered and events unexplained.<br />
The opening and ending sequences are pretty good, the opening song especially was very fitting to the theme of the Anime along with being a good song on its own.<br />
<br />
Conclusion and Verdict:<br />
Despite having a few problems, Steins;Gate stands as one of the most well made Anime's out there, one that in my opinion does the best job at presenting the concepts of time travel. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting story filled with twists, engaging events and awesome characters, give it a go and what you'll find is no doubt an amazing show.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle191971" onclick="reviewToggleText(191971)">read more</a></div>

		</div>When you walk the streets of Akihabara, you’re bound to run into many weird things.  As the mecca of the otaku world, this district isn’t just a major electronics shopping center.  In addition to supplying you with anime merchandise for all ages(and I do mean ALL ages, including those quite a bit older than 18), you’re also likely to find cosplayers, concerts, maid cafes, an entire AKB0048 theater, and enough sexual imagery to make anyone not used to the culture believe they had fallen down the rabbit hole into a perverse misogynistic wonderland.<br />
<br />
And yet even the people who have been used to this <span style="display: none;" id="review192156">atmosphere their entire lives have no idea how to react to one of it’s most strange residents, the self-proclaimed mad scientist HOUEN KYOUMA!  By all outward appearances, Kyouma...  Or, Okabe Rintaro by birth...  Is an 18 year old man-child who refers to himself in the third person and always talks as though he’s unveiling his latest diabolic trap for Superman.  They think he’s delusional, but little do they...  Or even Okabe himself...  realize just accurate his claims are.  As crazy as he may sound, Okabe has, through some miracle of science, accidentally created a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past.  Will this inexplicable invention be his ticket to the fame and notoriety that he’s always imagined, or will it be the greatest mistake he’s ever made?<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate was produced by a relatively new animation studio called White Fox, and out of the dozen shows that they’ve put out, I unfortunately have only seen two others.  They did The Devil is a Part Timer, which I highly recommend, but they also did Akame Ga Kill, I show I dropped after seven episodes.  Both shows looked good despite having low budgets, and the same can be said of Steins;Gate.  It’s not a very expensive show, which is fine, because it doesn’t need to be.  The vast majority of it is dialogue heavy, alternating from people standing around talking to people walking around talking...  Or, in it’s cheapest moments, people standing around thinking or brooding.  It uses a lot of framing and perspective tricks to make these slower moments look less dull, and while I’d normally call a show pretentious for doing this, Steins;Gate never comes close to as bad with it as most Studio Shaft productions can get.<br />
<br />
When something other than talking is going on...  Say, during the more exciting moments of the show, of which there is a generous amount...  There isn’t a spike in the budget, like there would be with most shows, but they use a lot of clever editing tricks so the movement on screen appears more fluid than it really is, which I really appreciate...  After all, a well-managed small budget will almost always impress me more than an unrestrained big budget.  The character designs, while somewhat simplistic, are memorable enough.  The characters don’t exactly look realistic, but in the anime medium, they’re about as grounded and non-cartoony as you can get, one weird moe-girl aside.  The color scheme is dull, but it plays very well to the mature aesthetic of the series.<br />
<br />
Aside from the really quick and beautiful animations that happen whenever Okabe time travels, there’s nothing really special about the look of this series, distinctive and unique though it might be, but it works perfectly in context, and any more movement than it has would have just felt unnecessary.  <br />
<br />
The music is also barely noticeable, skulking around in the background of scenes as it does it’s job accentuating the tone of the show without ever standing out.  If you’re actually listening for it, the instrumental portion of the soundtrack is comprised primarily of soft piano pieces, although it’s not afraid to get loud and bombastic during it’s more intense scenes.  In terms of both music and animation, Steins;Gate never gets more awesome than it does with it’s opening theme, Hacking to the Gate, one of my favorite openings of the decade so far.  Having said that, this is one of those rare moments where I wish the series had split itself into two different openings, as Hacking to the Gate, with it’s fast pace, explosive tune and clock-related imagery overlaying unhappy characters in a way that makes them feel hopelessly trapped in time feels way too intense for the first half of the series.  Nevertheless, it’s pretty damn awesome.<br />
<br />
The English dub is a Funimation effort, which is normally a good sign...  Except for when they hire J. Michael Tatum as the script writer.  I ragged on him really hard in my Heroic Age review, and I still stand behind everything I said...  He’s a pretentious writer who thinks he’s better than the material, and makes a lot of really bad choices because of it.  In spite of this, his style is more or less perfect for a show like Steins;Gate, whose dialogue poses, tries to sound smarter than it is, and panders to the audience just as hard as Tatum does.  It made incessant references to Sci-Fi and nerd culture in the original Japanese, and Tatum clearly had a lot of fun Americanizing these references, throwing in nods to Star Trek, Doctor Who, and internet memes that fit well in context...  Mostly.  There are some quotes...  For example, a Leeroy Jenkins reference in the final episode...  that feel so out of place that you can’t help but notice Tatum’s giant wink to the audience.<br />
<br />
His passion for over-writing also finds it’s home here, as a character like Okabe can only improve as his dialogue becomes more stilted and over-the-top.  There are a few moments that do go way too far, one of the worst of which is a confrontation that Kurisu has with her father, who’s lines were so bad that the actor himself doesn’t sound comfortable reading them.  Aside from that, it mostly works, and there are only a few moments where different characters sound the same(Mayuri and Dabu both using the phrase “Interwebs,” for instance.  Stop trying to sound cool, Tatum).<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the acting in general is above par.  Tatum actually sounds slightly better in the lead role than Mamoru Miyano did, which is a real feat when you consider just how awesome Miyano was with the character.  Being able to both write and act as an over-the-top melodramatic nut-job like Okabe was clearly a huge inspiration for him, and he takes it to gleeful extremes.  The only actor in the cast who really surpasses him is Trina Nishimura in the role of Kurisu, the show’s only truly scientific-sounding character.  She plays her with a reserved dignity that smooths out any tsundere edge that the character may have had, and she pulls off Kurisu’s emotional nuance flawlessly.  She’s the rock of Okabe’s team, and Trina makes you believe it.<br />
<br />
Jad Saxton and Cherami Leigh do wonderful jobs as usual.  They’re both basically playing characters that they’ve played several times before, so this is well-known ground for them, and their veteran instincts carry them through.  Relative newcomer Jessica Cavanaugh had a disproportionately tough job with the character of Moeka, who spend the majority of the series speaking quietly and delivering very few lines, but then suddenly having to scream hysterically at the top of her lungs in her big episode, so I have to give her props for pulling it off.  As for Daru and Mayuri...  Well, let’s just say the actors did the best they could to make them less annoying.<br />
<br />
The characters are acted well over-all, which is a good thing, because the sad truth is that they’re not written very well.  There are a handful of good or likeable characters, but there are only two in the main cast that I didn’t have any serious problems with...  Moeka, the cell phone girl, and Suzuha, the part-timer.  They’re both tied very tightly to the plot, and while they initially meander for much of the first half, they don’t disappoint in the long run.  Also, neither one is after Okabe’s dick.<br />
<br />
The two main characters, Okabe and Kurisu, are really likeable.  Okabe is an interesting and highly dynamic character, and he has a great developmental arc throughout the story, but he’s not believable.  He represents two of Japans more recent social issues...  He’s a NEET, or “Not in Employment or Educational Training(at least in the anime),” and he’s also a chuunibyo, or an adult who can’t let go of his childhood fantasies.  And yet, his weird and socially inept ways are justified by the fact that he’s made one of the most important inventions of all time, and he has three very attractive people so in love with him that they’re willing to do horrible things to themselves just because he asked them to.  Hell, he even has a best friend who’s a complete skeezwad otaku just so he can look dignified by comparison.  He’s the perfect self-insert fantasy for the very people he’s representing.<br />
<br />
And Kurisu?  Yes, she’s awesome, but she’s supposed to be awesome.  She’s awesome by design, and I don’t mean that in a good way.  She’s a nerd’s perfectly idealized girlfriend.  Even if it weren’t for her cool head, high tolerance level for absurd people, and laid back personality, she’s still that unrealistic fantasy girl who’s willing to look past your awkwardness and terrible first impression just because your differences from other people are charming to her.  I firmly disagree with anybody who calls her a tsundere, as she only acts abrasively towards Okabe when he deserves it for antagonizing her, but she’s still basically a magical girlfriend without the magic.<br />
<br />
Then you have Faris and Ruka, whom...  And I’m sorry to say this...  The show would be better off without.  Their only two purposes in the story are to extend the plot by a few episodes and be Okabe’s other two love interests, and they’re both very problematic in their own ways.  With Faris, we never find out exactly why she has such a high opinion of Okabe...  I mean, if she was just playing along with his BS because he’s a customer, that would be fine, but we get no indication of that.  And the idea of a teenage girl being indirectly responsible for the development of Akihabara’s moe culture is a whole other can of worms.<br />
<br />
And Ruka...  Well, anime normally isn’t kind with it’s portrayal of LGBT characters, but this one crosses a brand new line.  He...  Well, she, I guess?  She’s a biological male who identifies as a female.  She uses the time machine to change her gender to the one that feels right, and while her character does involve some ignorant stereotypes, it doesn’t really become a problem until Okabe asks her to change herself back for plot reasons, to which her response is basically “Sure, I’ll go back to my old miserable life in order to prevent a greater tragedy from happening...  If you go on a date with me!”  Holding the greater good hostage just to spend some time with our favorite awkward adonis.  And of course she’s also in love with him when she’s a boy, because stereotypes.<br />
<br />
I’ve already mentioned in Okabe’s description what Daru’s role in the series is, although I do appreciate the attempt to develop him further through his relationship to Suzuha.  But Mayuri is the worst.  No, let me rephrase that:  Mayuri is THE WORST, all capitals.  She’s a doe-eyed infantilized moe blob, or basically a toddler with big boobs.  Aside from humanizing Okabe, her purpose is to make the viewer feel like she needs to be protected, thus adding more emotional stakes to the second half of the series.<br />
<br />
If you haven’t seen the show, but have heard a lot of word of mouth about it, you’ve probably heard something along these lines;  “The first half was really slow, but when the second half kicked in, it became the most awesome thing ever!”  Or something of the like.  I don’t personally agree with that assessment...  The pacing of the first half never bothered me, and the second half had more than enough problems that I’ll get to in a minute...  But what I do take issue with is when people refer to it as one of the smartest shows they’ve ever seen.  Now, I’m not saying Steins;Gate is a dumb show...  It knows what it’s doing, and to that end, it never falters...  What I’m saying is that it’s full of shit.  <br />
<br />
I can’t say much about it’s time travel logic without giving away too many spoilers, but it does cheat towards the end and go in the Back to the Future direction.  What I can talk about is the huge turning point that everybody loves so much.  Halfway through the series, a tragic event occurs, and Okabe starts using the time machine over and over again to try and prevent said tragedy, but his efforts prove futile.  This is fine at first, until it’s revealed that even when the cause of the tragedy is completely removed, the tragedy still happens in all of it’s Final Destination glory.  Frankly, if you can get through this story arc without even once saying “Oh My God, They Killed Kenny!”, then this show has you by the short and curlies.<br />
<br />
Since Steins;Gate is a Sci-Fi story, there are a lot of things it doesn’t need to explain...  It is, after all, Science fiction, not science fact.  It doesn’t bother to explain how a Microwave can send texts through time, but it doesn’t need to, because no time machine in the history of fiction has ever been fully explained.  They give you a few details and you just take it on faith.  It never explains how Okabe got his Reading Steiner ability, or the ability to retain his memories from alternate timelines, but it doesn’t need to, because Okabe’s the main character, and he needs to have some element of chosen-ness in order to be special.  As far as these two details go, everything’s fine.<br />
<br />
But if you’re going to insert a giant game-changing plot twist into the middle of a story, it has to follow some sort of in-universe logic.  The tragic event I mentioned earlier does not.  It never gets explained as anything other than an accepted repercussion of time travel.  I guess the best way to describe it would be to imagine that you’re stacking dominoes, and you have a pit of lava in your living room.  I don’t know why, just go with it.  No matter where you aim the line-up of dominoes, the last one will inevitably land in the lava, regardless of what room it ends in.  Now, a normal person would be curious...  Is Chell playing a joke on you?  But Okabe and Kurisu are not curious.  They immediately accept it as a scientific inevitability, and immediately jump to possible solutions, probably to save the writers the effort of coming up with a reason for this conflict that still smells like the place they pulled it out of.  Hell, even a stupid explanation like “Okabe’s meddling with life and death pissed off the Grim Reaper” would have been a better explanation than no explanation.<br />
<br />
And if that’s not bad enough, the idea of other people retaining their memories of past timelines through flashbacks is bullshit.  There are several moments where characters that Okabe’s interacting with have visions of their past lives to corroborate with what he’s telling them, and of course, it only ever occurs when it’s convenient for him.  He tries to explain it by saying that everybody has Reading Steiner to some degree, but this makes no sense whatsoever.  I can think of any number of characters who, if they retained certain memories from past timelines, would have been able to screw Okabe and his friends over six ways from sunday.<br />
<br />
Now, I know I’ve been very negative in those last few paragraphs, and that’s because I was saying things I haven’t heard often, and that I felt needed to be said.  But the truth is, Steins;Gate does more right than it does wrong.  It’s adapted from a light novel/dating game, which is a notoriously hard source to adapt from, and while it’s attempts to build stories out of two of the side characters’ romantic paths does make for some infuriating filler episodes, it still weaves a better story than any other light novel based anime that I’ve seen.  I haven’t played the original game, but from what I’ve heard, they left a lot of the more ridiculous content by the wayside.<br />
<br />
I also appreciate the slow pace of the first half a lot more than other people I’ve talked to about it.  Steins;Gate did a great job slowly developing the story and dipping it’s characters further and further down the rabbit hole, dropping subtle clues about the disaster to come when the story gets serious.  The build-up is fantastic, and the relationship between the characters and their interactions with each other kept me from ever getting bored.  Yes, I said the characters are calculated and unrealistic in the way they’re written, but the friendship and chemistry between them does feel real, and it comes from a very believable place, so I can’t completely write them off.  Not most of them, anyway.<br />
<br />
Nor can I write off the overall story.  I don’t think it’s the work of pure genius everyone else does...  Sorry, I don’t...  But it’s still a pretty damn good mystery, with enough build-up and payoff to keep you on the edge of your seat from episode to episode even after multiple viewings, noticing small, seemingly insignificant details you might have missed on previous viewings.  It’s at it’s best when it’s focused on this mystery, and to that effect, it’s executed really well...  And even when it’s not, it’s emotionally resonant enough for it’s flaws to be largely excusable.  But as a sci-fi time traveling show, it really does make shit up as it goes along.<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate is available from Funimation.  It was originally released in blu-ray/DVD combo half-packs, but it has since been released as one product in the Anime classics format, and for a much more affordable rate than before.  The original visual novel has been released stateside for several formats including the PS3, with the text actually translated, but I haven’t played it and probably won’t for a while.  The 2013 movie, Fuka Ryoiki No Deja Vu, has not yet been released stateside, but it has been licensed by Funimation, and good news:  It’s not a cash-grab movie!  It’s an actual sequel!  A sequel series named Steins;Gate 0 has been announced, and appears to be set in an alternate universe that Okabe left behind.<br />
<br />
You can love an anime series while impartially acknowledging that it has problems, and that’s the camp I find myself in with this series.  Steins;Gate doesn’t really live up to all of the hype, nor does it deserve it, but it’s still a pretty awesome series.  It’s well produced and cleverly directed, and it’s original enough that I can honestly say I’ve never seen any series like it before.  I guess it kind of reminds me of Angel Beats, insofar as the fact that it works far better emotionally than logically, but that’s pretty much it.  The comedy and drama are blended well, but it’s just too problematic for me to give it the high mark it’s clearly aiming for.  Just like all of Okabe’s friends, I accept this show and all of it’s weirdness and pretense.  I give Steins;Gate a 7/10.</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle192156" onclick="reviewToggleText(192156)">read more</a></div>

They also show the different sacrifices that have to be made in order to obtain what is necessary. However, Steins;Gate provides more character development compared to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, probably because of the longer length in the number of episodes.&nbsp;</div>

<br />
Don't be deceived by sugary opening and first episodes of Madoka! It's MUCH darker than it appears at first look, I would even say it is far more serious and dramatic than S;G. Story is written by Gen Urobuchi, who publicly "apologized for intentionally misleading people that Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is a cute healing anime". Wikipedia describes its <span style="display: none;" id="recommend61325">genre as "Drama, Horror, Magical girl, Tragedy", and MAL as "Magic, Psychological, Thriller".</span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle61325" onclick="recommendToggleText(61325)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

Both start out as what seem to be very lighthearted and playful only to suddenly become really dark and serious. Moreover, both have a heavy focus on the suffering of the characters.

This is just my opinion, but I wouldn't hesitate to say these two are both modern anime masterpieces.&nbsp;</div>

Both are my personal favorites. A recommendation for both of them. <br />

Steins; Gate- After you watch it rewatch it.<br />
<br />
Madoka- I feel it should be watched through the movies, Beginnings (1), Eternal (2) and Rebellion (3, also different story). The first two are just all of the episodes put together with new scenes that add onto the feel I feel it adds onto the character development as well. </span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle110568" onclick="recommendToggleText(110568)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

Both anime start off with simple, easy to understand plots, that don't bore you before they get REALLLY good. Trust me, to those who watched Stein's;Gate and think it is as original and one of a kind as it get's....well it is. But Madoka sure make's a good counter. Personally, I perfered Madoka to Stein's;Gate (barely, but there both FANTASTIC IN EVERYWAY POSSIBLE), but if you've watched and enjoyed one of them you will love the other as well!&nbsp;</div>

These animes has one very similar aspect, but with one big difference.<br />
<br />
In mirai nikki you know your future, in steins gate you know your past. They know how to change their future in mirai nikki and they know how to change their past in steins gate. But what they both do not know is what will happen if they change it. Even the fact if you make it worse or better is never clear. Of course you can always think that it cannot get any badder. <br />
<br />
The other fact is that they know their past and future immediately after that. <span style="display: none;" id="recommend86085">So they can change it once more.<br />
<br />
The big difference is of course future and past in this theorie. Other difference are that steins gate has a more complicated plot and mirai nikki has yuno with all the battles accompanied with all the blood :).</span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle86085" onclick="recommendToggleText(86085)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

Both are deep and most importantly, these shows have AMAZING character development.  We can feel their tremendous growth, their motives, and their ambitions.

					<div class="spaceit_pad">The many-worlds interpretation and quantum physics. Not your usual anime bedfellows. Both series deal with time travel under the assumption that every choice we make can create an alternate, divergent time-line / dimension. <br />
<br />
Noein is a lot more ambitious than Steins;Gate, which preferred to stay within time travel limited to days-weeks and the same area. In Noein, the other selves of the child cast time travel with enhanced bodies; conversing with their younger selves as they fight using superpowers and struggle to sustain their bodies in a dimension they don't belong in. The future involving an entity known as 'Noein' destroying all alternate <span style="display: none;" id="recommend102383">dimensions is a clear reality. Steins, on the other hand, shows nothing of its future; just mentioning what happens.<br />
<br />
Okabe in Steins uses time travel between time-lines as a sort of... ladder. He has to do such and such to make a number go high enough to change from a few preset futures. Noein differs in its approach since it presents each dimension as an individual one that all lead to doom only because one of the other dimensions is destroying the others. </span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle102383" onclick="recommendToggleText(102383)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Both anime is about time-travelling and the mechanism is used excellently in both stories. Noein spends a bit more time with the "future" worlds than Steins;Gate does and feels a bit more darker/moody than Steins;Gate because the latter had more funny dialogue. Aside from that, Steins;Gate generally had better characters so expect some differences in characterization (Noein had a younger cast in the present timelines), but character developments in both was quite well done.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Parallel worlds, time travel, convergence, unlimited possible futures, hopelessness, despair, different space-time theories, inability to escape from fate and of course people who (un)willingly screw everything up... They share so many tropes! Even the character design is somewhat similar, although Noein takes more risks, I'd say. It seems to me that Steins;Gate is more otaku-oriented while Noein is more of a slice-of-life and romance. Nonetheless, both anime excel in plot twists and characterization, as well as entertainment value.&nbsp;</div>

<br />
Noein focuses more on the Dragon Knights from La'cryma (one of Earth's possible future) coming to the present to retrieve an 'object' called 'Dragon Torque' in order to save their world. As the Dragon knights enters into this timeline (the present) by accident, one of the Knights realised that this timeline is very similar to theirs and swore to protect the dragon torque at all costs. The others insists that it is just an illusion and the torque is just a tool, <span style="display: none;" id="recommend32891">but he swore to not cause damage into this timeline.<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate focuses on one group of people who managed to create the worlds first time machine. The main character kept experimenting with it and realises that it can be used to change the past, present, future by sending just an message. He tries to help his friends to change the world into a pleasant world for them when he realises that, for each message that he sents, one of his friend would be killed a day earlier. Whats more, they found out that a few years later, a corporation would use their time machine to rule over the world, turning everybody into human slaves. In order to prevent these from happening, he needs to cause minimal changes onto a world to save his assistant to prevent this incident to occur. Thus he set off going trough crazy amount of time trying to save both people.<br />
<br />
Both shows can cause a viewer to be confused  although Noein's confusion occurs later in the show compared to Steins;Gate.</span>&nbsp<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="recommendToggle32891" onclick="recommendToggleText(32891)">read more</a>&nbsp;</div>

<br />
Give this anime the first 10 episodes for plot and character development--THEN it gets exciting and addictive. But all of the episodes are beautifully done (acting and artwork are amazing).

Some differences include: <br />
 - Noein is more fantasy whereas Steins;Gate tries to be more realistic.<br />

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Both involve a complicated and confusing story that unfolds itself in the end. Both involve redoing the same period of time over and over again(though its repeated more in Higurashi). I thought that Higurashi was more physiological but it doesn't mean Stein's Gate was any less interesting. If you liked one you'll definitely like the other.&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="spaceit_pad">- Both have different timelines and worlds<br />
- Each time they mess up in another world they jump to another one.<br />
- Tries to save someone's life <br />

					<div class="spaceit_pad">Tragedy, frustration and efforts that seem vain are present in both of these series.<br />
<br />
The sci-fi/supernatural approach is similar, but they have different plots overall.<br />
<br />
The hooks in both series are also simlar, as they build questions and curiosity whenever they have the chance. Pretty much masters of pace.&nbsp;</div>
