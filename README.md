Atarashii MAL API
=================

This software is an unofficial API for the MyAnimeList website built on the
Symfony PHP framework.

Due to a poor official API that offers spotty coverage, the need exists for
something that offers more features in a REST-ful manner.

The API "1.0" version tries, where possible, to offer the same interface as
provided by the [unofficial MyAnimeList API](https://github.com/chuyeow/myanimelist-api).
Please review COMPATIBILITY for a list of differences.

Download

Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/ratan12/atarashii-api

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

You will need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to set up the project.

Additionally, you will need to get a user agent whitelisted with MyAnimeList.
See [this forum topic](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=682709) for
information on what to do.

Once downloaded, run `composer install` in the root directory to install the
Symfony components and configure the core application parameters.

You can either run the application on PHP's built-in web server or configure it
as an application on a full web server.

For the built-in server, run `php app/console server:run`. If you configure on a
web server, set the document root as the web directory.
