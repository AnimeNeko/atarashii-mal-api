Atarashii MAL API
=================

This software is an unofficial API for the MyAnimeList website built on the
Symfony PHP framework.

Due to a poor official API that offers spotty coverage, the need exists for
something that offers more features in a REST-ful manner.

The API "1.0" version tries, where possible, to offer the same interface as
provided by the [unofficial MyAnimeList API](https://github.com/chuyeow/myanimelist-api).
Please review COMPATIBILITY for a list of differences.
